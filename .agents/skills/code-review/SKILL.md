# /code-review

Multi-tier review for Spellbook. The product here is the **agent-shaped
coating** — skills, agents, hooks, lint gates. Reviews anchor to
`harnesses/shared/AGENTS.md` red flags and the invariants in
`.spellbook/repo-brief.md`. You are the marshal: read the diff, let Dagger
do the automated first pass, dispatch human-judgment reviewers in parallel,
synthesize, fix blockers, loop.

## What Gets Reviewed Here

Almost every diff in this repo is one of:

1. **Skill changes** — `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` + `references/`. Judgment
   encoding. Triggerable frontmatter. Self-containment. <500 lines.
2. **Agent changes** — `agents/<name>.md`. Scoped persona. Tool restrictions.
3. **Dagger gate changes** — `ci/src/spellbook_ci/main.py`. A new gate is a
   load-bearing wall (Red Line: never lower quality gates).
4. **Bootstrap / scripts** — `bootstrap.sh`, `scripts/*.sh`, `scripts/*.py`.
   Cross-harness install paths. Portable paths. Pre-commit hooks.
5. **Harness config** — `harnesses/{claude,codex,pi,shared}/…`. Shared
   AGENTS.md is doctrine; per-harness settings must stay parity-equivalent.

If the diff looks like a typical "feature" change on app code, something is
wrong — this repo has no app. Check the diff scope before proceeding.

## Marshal Protocol

### 0. Let Dagger do the first pass

Before spawning any reviewer, run (or confirm the caller ran):

```bash
dagger call check --source=.
```

The 12 parallel gates catch everything mechanical. Named gates (see
`.spellbook/repo-brief.md` for the full table):

- `lint-yaml`, `lint-shell` (shellcheck), `lint-python` (py_compile)
- `check-frontmatter` — required fields, line limits
- `check-index-drift` — `index.yaml` must match generator output
- `check-vendored-copies`, `check-exclusions`
- `check-portable-paths` — no `/Users/<name>/` outside Claude-only paths
- `check-harness-install-paths` — seed/tailor writes must not be Claude-only
- `check-deliver-composition` — `/deliver` must compose via trigger syntax
- `check-no-claims` — no `claims.sh` under `skills/`

**Reviewers must not re-run or duplicate these checks.** If Dagger failed,
the fix is `dagger call heal --source=. --model=gpt-4.1 --attempts=2` or a
builder sub-agent — not a human reviewer restating what shellcheck already
said. Reviewer cycles are for judgment Dagger can't form.

### 1. Read the diff

`git diff $BASE...HEAD` (default base: `master`). Classify: which of the five
change categories above? What does this diff touch? What doesn't it touch
that it probably should (tests, references/, frontmatter, index regen)?

### 2. Select the philosophy bench (static map)

Run the selection algorithm in `references/bench-map.yaml`:

- `git diff --name-only $BASE...HEAD` → changed files
- Start from `default` (`critic`, `ousterhout`, `grug`)
- Union `add` agents for every rule whose glob matches any changed file
- De-dup; cap at 5 with `critic` pinned

Available bench (philosophy agents under `/Users/phaedrus/Development/spellbook/agents/`):

| Agent | Lens | Best on Spellbook diffs |
|---|---|---|
| **critic** | correctness/depth/simplicity/craft rubric | every review |
| **ousterhout** | deep modules, information hiding | SKILL.md restructuring, new skill interfaces, Dagger gate composition — catches *shallow modules* and *pass-through layers* |
| **grug** | complexity demon | catches *semantic workflow DSLs around general agents*, *speculative abstractions*, and scaffolding that compensates for strong models |
| **carmack** | shippability, direct implementation | bootstrap/scripts, bash harnesses, "is this the simplest working thing" |
| **beck** | TDD, YAGNI | new test coverage for scripts/, python modules, eval fixtures |

No a11y triad. This repo has no UI surface — if an a11y reviewer shows up in
a bench for this repo, the map is broken.

See `references/internal-bench.md` for lens detail and prompt guidance.

### 3. Dispatch the three judgment tiers in parallel

| Tier | What | How |
|---|---|---|
| Philosophy bench | 3-5 Explore sub-agents with named lenses | Agent tool, tailored prompts. Read-only. |
| Thinktank review | 10 reviewers across 8 model providers | `thinktank review` CLI. See `references/thinktank-review.md` |
| Cross-harness | Codex + Gemini CLIs (skip whichever you are) | See `references/cross-harness.md` |

Parallel dispatch only — sequential here wastes wall time. Thinktank gotcha:
wait for the process to exit, or for `trace/summary.json` to reach `complete`
or `degraded` with a `run_completed` event in `trace/events.jsonl`, before
you consume the run. Mid-run directories are not final artifacts.

### 4. Synthesize

Collect all outputs. Deduplicate findings. Rank by severity:

- **Blocking** — correctness, security, cross-harness parity violation,
  self-containment violation (`../..`, `$REPO_ROOT/…`), lowered quality gate,
  broken frontmatter, direct `dagger call check` inside `skills/deliver/SKILL.md`
  (fails `check-deliver-composition`).
- **Important** — shallow module, pass-through layer, speculative abstraction,
  SKILL.md over 500 lines, description not assertive/triggerable, untested
  script, regex over agent prose, semantic workflow DSL.
- **Advisory** — naming, style, ordering, doc polish.

### 5. Verdict

No blocking findings → **Ship**. Any blocking → fix loop.

## Fix Loop

For each blocking finding, spawn a **builder** sub-agent with file:line and
the specific fix instruction. Builder applies strategic (Ousterhout) and
simple (grug) fixes, runs `dagger call check --source=.`, commits atomically.

After all fixes land, **re-dispatch all three judgment tiers** (full, not
spot-check). Loop until clean. Max 3 iterations — escalate to human if still
blocked; repeated blocks usually mean the shape was wrong, not the code.

## Review Judgment — What This Repo's Reviewer Actually Adds

Dagger catches syntax, frontmatter, portable paths, composition, drift.
The reviewer's cycles go to things Dagger cannot evaluate. Named red flags
from `harnesses/shared/AGENTS.md` to cite verbatim:

> Shallow modules, pass-through layers, hidden coupling, large diffs,
> untested branches, speculative abstractions, stale context,
> responding to agent errors with prose instead of structural fixes,
> regexes over agent prose, semantic workflow DSLs around general agents.

Additional Spellbook-specific checks:

- **Does the skill encode JUDGMENT, not procedure?** If the model already
  knows how, delete the skill. A SKILL.md that reads like a runbook for a
  strong model is dead weight. Reference form: `skills/flywheel/SKILL.md`
  (43 lines). (Memory: *feedback_bitter_lesson_skill_design*.)
- **Cross-harness first (Red Line).** What does this do on Codex? On Pi?
  Anchoring a design on Claude's `enabledPlugins` or Codex's `/plugins`
  without a filesystem-level base is a parity violation. Prior art:
  `harnesses/pi/settings.json:skills[]`.
- **Self-containment.** No `../..`, no `$REPO_ROOT/…` sourcing. Scripts
  resolve via `readlink -f` + `$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/…`. State roots anchor to
  the *invoking* project's `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Symlink-install
  + invoke from a foreign project is the canonical test.
- **Thin harness over semantic orchestration.** Scaffold that tells a strong
  model *how* to think generically is a grug target. Keep invariants it
  cannot infer; delete the rest.
- **Description is the trigger.** Frontmatter `description` must be
  assertive — not "this skill helps with X" but "Use when: <concrete
  signals>. Trigger: /foo."
- **`/deliver` composition.** Any diff under `skills/deliver/` must compose
  atomic phase skills (`/code-review`, `/ci`, `/qa`, `/implement`,
  `/refactor`, `/shape`) via trigger syntax. Raw `dagger call check` inside
  `/deliver` fails `check-deliver-composition` — flag blocking.
- **No `references/<repo-name>.md` sidecars.** Repo-specific content belongs
  in SKILL.md body. Stack-topic references (`references/convex-patterns.md`)
  are fine; `references/bitterblossom.md` is not.
- **No `index.yaml` edits.** Pre-commit regenerates it. A human-edited
  `index.yaml` in the diff is either churn or drift — flag.
- **Plausible ≠ correct.** SKILL.md prose that sounds right but fails the
  subtractive test (could describe any Next.js or Elixir repo verbatim) is
  shallow. Reviewer must demand repo-specific anchors.

## Spellbook-Shaped Review Examples

**Diff: new skill `skills/rebase/SKILL.md`.**
Bench (via map): `critic`, `ousterhout`, `grug`. Judgment calls: does it
encode judgment or procedure? Does the description trigger? Does it touch
`../..`? Cross-harness: does it work on Codex/Pi? Red flags to hunt:
*speculative abstractions*, *semantic workflow DSLs*.

**Diff: new Dagger gate in `ci/src/spellbook_ci/main.py`.**
Bench: `critic`, `ousterhout`, `carmack` (shell/python), `beck` (test
coverage). Judgment calls: is this gate load-bearing or ceremony? Does it
compose with existing parallel gates without serializing? Does it have a
deterministic failure mode? Does `heal` have a recipe for it? Red Line:
lowering any existing threshold is a blocker.

**Diff: bootstrap.sh change.**
Bench: `critic`, `carmack`, `grug`. Judgment calls: does it preserve
symlink + download parity? If it adds a skill, does it belong in
`GLOBAL_SKILLS` or is it per-repo content for `/tailor` / `/seed`?
Does it honor the COPIED-not-symlinked exception for
`harnesses/claude/settings.json`? Red flag: *hidden coupling* between
bootstrap and harness-specific settings.

**Diff: agent persona update under `agents/`.**
Bench: `critic`, `ousterhout`, `grug`. Judgment calls: tool restrictions
coherent with scope? Does the persona add structural guarantees a
general-purpose ad-hoc subagent wouldn't? Named agents exist for structural
reasons (shared AGENTS.md) — if it's just prose, it should be ad-hoc.

## Review Scoring

After the final verdict, append one JSON line to `.groom/review-scores.ndjson`
(create `.groom/` if needed):

```json
{"date":"2026-04-20","pr":null,"correctness":8,"depth":7,"simplicity":9,"craft":8,"verdict":"ship","providers":["claude","thinktank","codex","gemini"]}
```

Scores (1-10) are cross-provider consensus, not any single reviewer. `pr`
is the PR number or `null` for a branch. `verdict` is `ship`, `conditional`,
or `dont-ship`. Committed to git; `/groom` reads it for quality trends.

**Current reality (backlog.d/023):** the feedback loop on
`.groom/review-scores.ndjson` is operationally empty — scores are written
but not yet consumed by `/groom`. Write them anyway; closing that loop is
tracked work.

## Verdict Ref (git-native review proof)

After scoring, record the verdict as a git ref so `/settle` and pre-merge
hooks can enforce review without depending on GitHub PRs:

```bash
source scripts/lib/verdicts.sh
verdict_write "<branch>" '{"branch":"<branch>","base":"<base>","verdict":"<ship|conditional|dont-ship>","reviewers":[...],"scores":{...},"sha":"<HEAD-sha>","date":"<ISO-8601>"}'
```

- Write on every review, not just "ship" — a `dont-ship` verdict blocks
  `/settle --land`.
- `sha` MUST be `git rev-parse HEAD` at review time. New commits after
  review make the verdict stale; `/settle` re-triggers review.
- Verdict refs live under `refs/verdicts/<branch>` and sync via `git
  push/fetch`.
- Also write `.evidence/<branch>/<date>/verdict.json` for browsability.
- Escape hatch `SPELLBOOK_NO_REVIEW=1` is handled at the caller
  (`scripts/land.sh`, `pre-merge-commit`), never inside this skill.

## Gotchas

- **Duplicating Dagger.** Reviewers restating frontmatter errors or shellcheck
  warnings is wasted cycles. If `dagger call check` is red, run `heal` or
  spawn a builder — don't spawn a human-judgment bench to re-read the error.
- **Self-review leniency.** Models overrate their own work. Reviewers MUST
  be separate sub-agents, not the builder evaluating itself.
- **Reviewing the whole repo.** Review the diff, not the catalog. Scope is
  `git diff $BASE...HEAD`.
- **Skipping tiers for speed.** Philosophy bench alone is same-model depth,
  not diversity. Thinktank + cross-harness (Codex, Gemini) provide real
  foundation diversity. Same-model self-critique is theater
  (see AGENTS.md "Diverge Before You Converge").
- **Misreading a live Thinktank run.** `review.md`, `summary.md`, and
  `agents/*.md` may appear only late. Watch stderr JSON progress or
  `trace/summary.json`, not just the directory listing. `thinktank review
  eval` is broken in 6.3.0 — consume final stdout JSON or finished files.
- **Treating all concerns equally.** Blocking = correctness, security,
  cross-harness parity, self-containment, lowered gate. Style preferences
  don't gate shipping.
- **A11y bench on this repo.** If the map adds an a11y reviewer, the map is
  broken — no UI surface exists here. Fix the map.
- **Over-prescribing prompts.** You are the marshal. Craft prompts that fit
  the diff. The references describe lenses, not scripts.
- **Reviewing tailor-owned files.** `/tailor`-written files carry a
  `.spellbook` marker with `installed-by: tailor`. A diff that modifies
  tailor-owned content by hand is a scope question — confirm with the user
  before reviewing as a normal change.
