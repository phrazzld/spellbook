# /groom

Strategic backlog management. Parallel investigation, synthesis, themed recommendations.

## Execution Stance

You are the executive orchestrator.
- Keep synthesis, prioritization, and recommendation decisions on the lead model.
- Delegate investigation and evidence gathering to focused subagents.
- Run independent investigators in parallel by default.

## Modes

| Mode | Intent |
|------|--------|
| **explore** (default) | Parallel investigation → synthesized themes → prioritized backlog items |
| **rethink** | Deep architectural exploration of a target system → one clear recommendation |
| **moonshot** | Explore variant — Strategist thinks from first principles, ignoring current backlog |
| **scaffold** | Project bootstrapping — quality gates, test infrastructure, CI, linting |
| **tidy** | Prune, reorder, archive completed items |

## Backlog Format: backlog.d/

```
backlog.d/
├── 001-fix-auth-rotation.md
├── 002-add-webhook-retry.md
└── _done/
    └── 000-initial-scaffold.md
```

Each file:
```markdown
# Fix auth token rotation

Priority: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | high | medium | low
Status: pending | ready | blocked | in-progress | done | shipped | abandoned
Estimate: S | M | L | XL

## Goal
<1 sentence — what outcome, not what mechanism>

## Non-Goals
- <what NOT to do>

## Oracle
- [ ] <mechanically verifiable criterion — prefer executable commands over prose>
- [ ] <"How will we know this is done?" — even rough oracles make items buildable>

## Notes
<context, constraints, prior art>
```

Closure markers for manual landings:
- `Closes backlog:<item-id>`
- `Ships backlog:<item-id>`

When work lands outside `/flywheel`, the landing commit should carry one of
those markers so `tidy` and `/flywheel` can detect stale active items.

When grooming Spellbook itself, shape items for downstream-repo usefulness first.
Spellbook-local work should survive only if it creates reusable primitives,
scaffolds, references, or policies; validates a proving-ground pattern meant to
transfer outward; or removes debt that materially blocks downstream adoption or
trust. See `references/backlog-doctrine.md` under "Spellbook Product Lens."

## Context Loading (all modes except tidy)

Before investigation, the orchestrator gathers baseline context:

1. Read `project.md` if it exists — store as project context for investigator prompts
2. Read `backlog.d/` — note existing items, their status, and any gaps
3. If `git-bug` is installed, read `git-bug bug status:open --format json` — note open issues
   alongside backlog.d items.
4. Read `.groom/retro/` if it exists — extract effort calibration and blocker patterns
5. Read `.groom/review-scores.ndjson` if it exists — pass summary statistics (average scores, verdict distribution, trend direction) to investigator prompts as baseline context
6. Read `exemplars.md` if it exists — note existing exemplars and pass to investigators as baseline context
7. **Cap check:** if >30 backlog items open, declare a reduction session (no new items until under cap)
8. Ask the user: "Anything on your mind? Bugs, friction, missing features?"

This takes <2 minutes. Do not block on missing artifacts — note their absence and proceed.

## Investigation Bench

Three named investigators per mode, all launched **in parallel** via the Agent tool
in a single message. See `references/investigation-bench.md` for full prompt templates.

**MANDATORY PARALLEL FANOUT.** All three investigators must launch simultaneously.
A grooming session that only runs one investigator has failed the investigation goal.

### Explore Investigators

| Investigator | Lens | Mandate | Agent Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Archaeologist** | Codebase health | Complexity hotspots, test gaps, coupling smells, dead code. "What's fragile?" | Explore |
| **Strategist** | Product opportunity | User journey friction, missing capabilities, competitive gaps. "What would users pay more for?" | Explore |
| **Velocity** | Effort patterns | Fix-to-feature ratio, churn hotspots, stalled work. "Where is effort not producing value?" | Explore |

For **moonshot** mode: the Strategist gets a modified prompt — "Forget the current backlog.
What's the single highest-leverage thing we're not building?"

### Rethink Investigators

| Investigator | Lens | Mandate | Agent Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mapper** | System topology | Deep dependency trace, data flows, coupling points. "What breaks if you pull any thread?" | Explore |
| **Simplifier** | Radical simplicity | From-scratch rebuild perspective. "What layers can be deleted?" | Plan |
| **Scout** | External perspectives | Invokes `/research thinktank`. "What has the industry learned that this codebase hasn't?" | general-purpose |

### Investigator Output Format (shared)

Every investigator returns this exact shape:

```markdown
## [Name] Report
### Top 3 Findings
1. [finding] — Evidence: [file:line / commit / metric]. Impact: high/med/low.
2. ...
3. ...
### Strategic Theme
[One sentence: the overarching theme these findings point to]
### Single Recommendation
[One concrete action. Not a list. Not "consider." A specific thing to do.]
```

## Synthesis Protocol

After all investigators return, the **orchestrator** (you) synthesizes. Do NOT present
raw findings. Do NOT delegate synthesis to a sub-agent — this requires product judgment.

0. **Premise challenge** — Audit the request's framing before theming. Is this
   the root problem or a downstream symptom? Five-whys the stated goal. If it's
   a symptom ticket, name the underlying need and re-anchor the synthesis there.
   Converging on solutions to the wrong problem is worse than silence.
1. **Cross-reference** — Which findings appear across 2+ investigators? (highest signal)
2. **Theme extraction** — Group findings into 2-4 strategic themes. A theme is a cluster
   of findings that share a root cause or a shared solution. Not individual items — themes.
3. **Dependency map** — Do any themes depend on others? (e.g., "test infrastructure" enables
   "safe refactoring")
4. **Rank** — Order by: (impact on product vision) × (feasibility) / (effort)
5. **Exemplar check** — For the highest-impact theme, check whether reference
   implementations would inform the recommendation. If so, invoke
   `/research exemplars` for that domain. If `exemplars.md` doesn't exist yet
   and worthy exemplars are found, offer to create it. Include discovered
   exemplars in theme presentation.
6. **Present** — One theme at a time. For each: evidence from investigators, recommended
   action, rough effort (S/M/L). Ask the user: explore deeper, write backlog item, or skip?

Output format:

```markdown
## Grooming Synthesis

### Investigator Convergence
[Findings that appeared from 2+ investigators — these are highest signal]

### Theme 1: [Name]
**Evidence:** Archaeologist found X, Strategist found Y, Velocity confirms Z.
**Recommendation:** [one concrete action]
**Effort:** S/M/L
**Impact:** [why this matters for the product vision]

### Theme 2: ...

### Dependency Order
Theme A enables Theme B. Recommend executing A first.
```

## Workflow: Explore

Phase-gated. Each phase must complete before the next begins.

### 1. CONTEXT — Load baseline (see Context Loading above)
### 2. INVESTIGATE — Launch all three explore investigators in parallel
Gate: all three returned structured reports.
### 3. SYNTHESIZE — Cross-reference, theme, rank (see Synthesis Protocol)
Gate: themes extracted with evidence and recommendations. Not raw findings.
### 4. DISCUSS — Present one theme at a time. Recommend, don't list.
Gate: user decides per theme (explore deeper / write item / skip).
### 5. WRITE — Create backlog.d/ files or git-bug issues for approved themes
Shaped work (goal + oracle + sequence) → `backlog.d/` files.
Raw bugs/findings (need investigation) → `git-bug bug new -t "..." -m "..." --non-interactive`,
then label with `git-bug bug label new <id> "priority/pN" "domain/X"`.
After creating git-bug issues, sync: `git-bug push origin`
(best-effort — if push fails, issues are safe locally; log the failure but don't block).
Gate: every item has Goal + Non-Goals + Oracle.
For Spellbook backlog items, make the downstream leverage or proving-ground rationale explicit.
Use `references/agent-issue-writing.md` for issue quality standards.
### 6. PRIORITIZE — Reorder backlog.d/ by value/effort ratio

## Workflow: Rethink

### 1. CONTEXT — Load baseline + user specifies the target system
### 2. INVESTIGATE — Launch all three rethink investigators in parallel
Gate: all three returned structured reports.
### 3. SYNTHESIZE — Distill into 2-3 architectural options with honest tradeoffs
Always include "do nothing" as a viable option.
### 4. RECOMMEND — Pick one option. Argue for it. Be opinionated.
Gate: one clear recommendation with reasoning.
### 5. DISCUSS — User approves, modifies, or rejects
### 6. WRITE — One backlog.d/ item for the recommended change

## Workflow: Scaffold

Bootstrap a new project with quality gates:
1. Test infrastructure (framework, coverage gates)
2. Linting (ESLint/Biome/clippy with strict rules)
3. Type checking
4. Pre-commit hooks
5. Local CI via Dagger (`dagger init --sdk=python`, then define quality gates as Dagger Functions).
   See spellbook's own `ci/` for reference. Prefer Dagger over GitHub Actions for the inner loop.
6. CLAUDE.md with project-specific instructions
7. `backlog.d/` directory for file-driven backlog
8. `exemplars.md` — invoke `/research exemplars` for the project's domain to seed initial reference implementations

## Workflow: Tidy

1. **Backlog audit** — count open items, check against 30-item cap
2. Archive completed items (`Status: done` or `Status: shipped`) to `backlog.d/_done/`
3. Archive active items that already carry `## What Was Built` or are closed
   by current-branch commit markers (`Closes backlog:<item-id>`,
   `Ships backlog:<item-id>`)
4. Delete stale items (>30 days untouched, no longer relevant)
5. Flag items stuck in `in-progress` with no recent commits — these are abandoned, not active
6. Verify each remaining item has Goal + Oracle
7. Verify completed items have a "What Was Built" section — if not, add one from git log
8. **git-bug audit** (if installed):
   - Close stale bugs (>30 days untouched, no activity)
9. Reorder remaining by priority
10. If BACKLOG.md / icebox exists, review it once, migrate any still-relevant items, then delete the legacy file so `backlog.d/` remains the only backlog source of truth

## Gotchas

- **Accepting the ticket's framing as given** — A `/groom X` request is the user's first-draft articulation, not a locked problem statement. Before the investigation bench, five-whys the request: is this the root problem or a downstream symptom? If the user asked to groom "feature X," investigate whether X is the right lens or a proxy. Symptom-level grooming produces symptom-level backlogs.
- **Investigators returning "everything is fine"** — Red flag. Push harder. Every codebase has findings; an investigator that found none didn't look.
- **Synthesis that lists findings without theming** — That's a report, not synthesis. Group into themes before presenting.
- **Themes without recommendations** — That's a menu, not grooming. Pick one action per theme and argue for it.
- **Running one investigator and calling it done** — Mandatory parallel fanout. All three, every time.
- **Items without oracles** — If you can't write a "definition of done" with checkable criteria, the item isn't scoped. Go back and scope it.
- **Over-decomposing** — An agent-hour of work is one item, not three. Compression ratios make most splits unnecessary.
- **Backlog as graveyard** — Items >30 days old with no progress are dead. Archive or delete during tidy.
- **Backward-compatible backlog artifacts** — Keeping `BACKLOG.md` around "for history" creates split-brain planning. Migrate what matters, then delete the legacy file.

## Principles

- **Investigate before opining** — parallel investigation first, opinions after evidence
- **Theme, don't itemize** — strategic themes, not feature laundry lists
- **Recommend, don't list** — always have an opinion, argue for it
- **One theme at a time** — don't overwhelm during discussion
- **Product vision is the ranking function** — rank by impact on the user, not technical elegance
- **Every item needs an oracle** — if you can't verify done, the item isn't ready
- **File-driven** — backlog.d/ is the source of truth
