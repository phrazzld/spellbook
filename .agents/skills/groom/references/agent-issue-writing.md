# Agent-Ready Issue Writing

## Principle

Treat the issue as a prompt for a senior coding agent.
Give the agent the goal, the local context, the quality bar, and the boundaries.
Do not replace thinking with a brittle step-by-step script.

## What to include

### Problem

State what is wrong or missing, with concrete evidence when available.

### Outcome

State what should be true when the issue is done.

### Context

Include only the context needed to make good decisions:
- user workflow
- architecture seam
- existing patterns
- relevant linked issues or docs

### Acceptance criteria

Write them so they can map to tests, commands, or visible behaviors.
Good tags:
- `[behavioral]`
- `[test]`
- `[command]`

### Boundaries

Say what should not change. This is often more valuable than extra implementation steps.

### Verification

Provide runnable commands when possible.

### Touchpoints

List likely files, modules, routes, tests, or data paths when known. These are starting points, not
prisons.

## What to avoid

- vague requests like “clean this up”
- giant multi-outcome tickets
- hidden dependencies in comments only
- instructions that describe exact shell steps instead of the desired result
- “etc”, “as needed”, or other scope leak phrases
- acceptance criteria that cannot be observed or tested

## Type-specific guidance

### Bug

Include:
- repro
- expected vs actual
- impact
- regression clues if known

### Feature

Include:
- user or operator value
- triggering surface
- rendering or API constraints
- deterministic facts the model must not invent

### Refactor

Include:
- invariants to preserve
- code smells or coupling to remove
- tests or checks that must stay green

### Research

Include:
- the decision to make
- what evidence to gather
- the expected output artifact
- what counts as sufficient confidence

## Recommended issue skeleton

```md
## Problem

## Outcome

## Context

## Acceptance Criteria
- [behavioral] Given ...
- [test] Given ...
- [command] When `...`, then ...

## Touchpoints
- `path/to/file`

## Verification
```bash
pnpm test ...
pnpm typecheck
```

## Boundaries

## Related

## AI-agent modification

Optimize for first-pass execution:
- prefer one issue per coherent diff
- keep prompts goal-oriented, not step-prescriptive
- include deterministic constraints explicitly
- separate exploration from implementation when uncertainty is high
- rewrite oversized issues before assigning them
