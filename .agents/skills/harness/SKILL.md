# /harness (spellbook self-edit)

This is spellbook — the harness library itself. Every operation here
mutates the source of truth: `skills/<name>/`, `agents/<name>.md`,
`harnesses/*/`, `registry.yaml`. The Dagger gate (`dagger call check
--source=.`) is the wall. Pre-commit regenerates `index.yaml`. Do not
hand-edit derived artifacts.

## Routing

| Intent | Reference |
|--------|-----------|
| Create a new skill or agent | `references/mode-create.md` |
| Eval a skill vs baseline | `references/mode-eval.md` |
| Lint a skill (12-gate preflight) | `references/mode-lint.md` |
| Convert agent ↔ skill (across harnesses) | `references/mode-convert.md` |
| Sync external sources via `registry.yaml` | `references/mode-sync.md` |
| Design harness improvements (hooks, gates, codification) | `references/mode-engineer.md` |
| Audit skill health and consolidation | `references/mode-audit.md` |

If no argument, ask: "What do you want to do? (create, eval, lint, convert,
sync, engineer, audit)"

## Spellbook-specific load-bearing facts

- **Source of truth lives here.** Skills are `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  (plus optional `references/`, `scripts/`). Agents are
  `agents/<name>.md`. `harnesses/shared/AGENTS.md` is THE principles
  file and is symlinked (not copied) to every harness dir by
  `bootstrap.sh`.
- **`dagger call check --source=.` is the gate.** Twelve parallel
  sub-gates (named by function in `ci/src/spellbook_ci/main.py`):
  `lint-yaml`, `lint-shell`, `lint-python`, `check-frontmatter`,
  `check-index-drift`, `check-vendored-copies`, `test-bun`,
  `check-exclusions`, `check-portable-paths`,
  `check-harness-install-paths`, `check-deliver-composition`,
  `check-no-claims`. Any new mechanism you add must survive all twelve.
- **`scripts/check-frontmatter.py`** enforces SKILL.md ≤ 500 lines and
  required `name` + `description` fields (agents require the same two;
  no line cap). Missing or malformed frontmatter fails the gate.
- **`scripts/generate-index.sh`** regenerates `index.yaml` from
  `skills/*/SKILL.md` and `agents/*.md`. The pre-commit hook
  (`.githooks/pre-commit`) re-runs it whenever those paths change. Do
  not hand-edit `index.yaml`; `check-index-drift` will fail.
- **`scripts/check-harness-agnostic-installs.sh`** blocks
  Claude-specific install wording from `skills/seed/SKILL.md`,
  `skills/tailor/SKILL.md`, and `index.yaml`. Required phrases on both
  skills: `shared skill root` (or `shared repo-local skill layer` /
  `shared skill layer`) and a description of `.claude/skills/` as a
  `bridge`. Forbidden: `into .claude/ with no filtering or tailoring`,
  `per-repo set of skills and agents in .claude/`, and `Copy every
  skill in ... into .claude/skills/`.
- **`scripts/sync-external.sh`** fetches external skill repos listed in
  `registry.yaml` into `skills/.external/<alias>/` (gitignored,
  per-machine state). Refuses floating refs (`main`/`HEAD`/branch)
  unless the source declares `allow_floating: true` or the operator
  passes `--allow-floating`. Every non-default source MUST set
  `alias_prefix:` — silent collisions are load-bearing bugs.
- **`scripts/lint-external-skills.sh`** flags hardcoded `/Users/`,
  `$HOME/.claude`, or `../../../` tree-escapes in installed externals.
  Use `--strict` in CI; advisory by default.
- **`bootstrap.sh` has two modes.** Symlink mode (local checkout found
  via `resolve_spellbook_dir` — honors `$SPELLBOOK_DIR`, then known
  locations; worktrees fall through to `$HOME/Development/spellbook`
  etc.) symlinks `skills/tailor` and `skills/seed` into each detected
  harness's skills dir, plus all `agents/*.md` into the harness agents
  dir. Download mode (`curl | bash`) pulls the same minimal set from
  GitHub. `harnesses/claude/settings.json` is COPIED and sanitized
  (dead-hook-path pruning), NOT symlinked — Claude mutates it at
  runtime. Changes require re-bootstrap.
- **Global install is minimal on purpose.** Only `/tailor` and `/seed`
  are globally symlinked; every other skill is installed per-repo by
  `/tailor` into `.agents/skills/` (canonical) with `.claude/skills/`
  and Codex/Pi mirrors as bridges.

## Cross-harness first (the Red Line)

Every skill, agent, hook, setting, or lint rule MUST work on Claude,
Codex, AND Pi. The filesystem + SKILL.md is the primary layer — every
harness scans its skills dir at startup. Anchoring a design on Claude
`enabledPlugins`, Codex `/plugins`, or Pi's unique features alone is a
bug. Prior art living in this repo: `harnesses/pi/settings.json`'s
`skills[]` glob ruleset (`+skills/...`, `!skills/**`) — filesystem-
level allow/deny that works by construction.

When a mechanism legitimately needs runtime toggling, emit per-harness
artifacts from one source (one manifest in-repo → Claude `plugin.json`
+ Codex `plugin.json` + Pi glob, rendered deterministically). If you
cannot answer "what does this do on Codex?", the design is incomplete.

## Agent-format translation

Claude and Codex-classic agents use YAML frontmatter (`name:`,
`description:`, `tools:`, optional `model:`, `disallowedTools:`) with
markdown body. Codex TOML profiles (`harnesses/codex/config.toml`) are
execution config, not personas — don't conflate. When converting, see
`references/mode-convert.md`; frontmatter field-mapping differs across
harnesses and silent drops (e.g. `disallowedTools`) lose behavior.

## Skill design quality standard

These govern every `/harness create|lint|eval`. They are the same
standard enforced by the Dagger gate where a gate exists, by prose
review otherwise.

1. **One skill = one domain, 1–3 workflows.** Five workflows is a
   refactor signal. 26 skills is the current steady state — justify
   additions against description tax.
2. **Token budget: 3k target, 5k ceiling.** `scripts/check-frontmatter.py`
   enforces the 500-line SKILL.md cap. Exemplars:
   `skills/flywheel/SKILL.md` (~43 lines — composer, states invariants),
   `skills/shape/SKILL.md` (~117 lines — invariant-first at larger scale).
3. **Mode content in `references/mode-*.md`.** Mandatory when a skill
   has >3 modes. Thin SKILL.md with a routing table; mode bodies under
   `references/`. This skill is the reference form.
4. **Encode judgment, not procedures.** If the model can derive the
   steps, delete the skill. Gotcha lists outperform happy-path prose.
   Exemplars: `skills/diagnose/SKILL.md` (routing table IS the skill),
   `skills/settle/SKILL.md` (mode detection IS the skill).
5. **Self-contained.** Scripts source only paths under `skills/<name>/`.
   Resolve `SCRIPT_DIR` via `readlink -f`; source libs from
   `$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/`; anchor state roots (cycles, locks, backlog) to
   the *invoking project's* `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, never the
   skill's install dir. The canonical test is symlink-install into a
   foreign project and invoke from there.
6. **Cross-harness first.** See Red Line above. A Claude-only
   mechanism is broken by construction.
7. **Description is the trigger.** Frontmatter `description:` is
   assertive (`"Use when: '...'"` with concrete phrases), not
   aspirational. If a skill doesn't fire, the description is wrong.
8. **Prose for an intelligent reader.** You are writing for an agent,
   not a Python interpreter. Phase-0/Phase-N flowcharts, exit-code
   routing tables, and deterministic scoring scripts inside SKILL.md
   are smells. Strip to invariants + a paragraph of "shape of the
   work." The agent fills sequencing.
9. **No `references/<repo-name>.md` sidecars.** Repo-specific body
   content belongs in SKILL.md itself. Stack-topic references
   (`references/convex-patterns.md`) are fine.

## Composition discipline (the `/deliver` rule)

`check-deliver-composition` forbids `skills/deliver/SKILL.md` from
inlining phase-skill internals. `/deliver` composes atomic phase skills
via their trigger syntax — `/code-review`, `/ci`, `/qa`, `/implement`,
`/refactor`, `/shape`. Forbidden inline: `dagger call check`, `bunx
playwright`, direct bench-agent dispatch (`Agent("critic"|"ousterhout"|...)`).
When designing new composers, follow the layering in
`references/mode-engineer.md`: leaf → composer → outer-loop.

## Dropped primitives (regression guard)

`check-no-claims` forbids `claims.sh`, `claim_acquire`, and
`claim_release` anywhere under `skills/`. Dropped per `backlog.d/032`.
Do not reintroduce.

## Bootstrap + install invariants

- Minimal global set: only `/tailor` and `/seed` are symlinked into
  `~/.{claude,codex,pi}/skills/`. Everything else is per-repo.
- `/tailor` writes into `.agents/skills/<name>/` (canonical shared
  root); `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, and Pi's `skills[]`
  configuration point at it (bridge layer). The `check-harness-install-paths`
  gate enforces this wording on `skills/seed` and `skills/tailor`.
- `harnesses/claude/settings.json` is COPIED (not symlinked) because
  Claude mutates it at runtime. Changes require re-bootstrap.
- Broken symlinks to `$SPELLBOOK/` are surfaced by
  `verify_no_broken_spellbook_symlinks` in `bootstrap.sh` — fix them at
  source, don't paper over.

## Registry discipline

`registry.yaml` declares external skill sources. Load-bearing rules
(enforced by `scripts/sync-external.sh`):

- Every non-default source declares `alias_prefix:`. Same prefix is
  allowed only when skill-name sets are provably disjoint (the two
  `vercel-labs/*` entries). Same prefix + same name = fatal.
- `pin: <full-sha>` is preferred. `ref: main/HEAD/<branch>` is
  refused unless `allow_floating: true`. TODOs in the file that say
  "pin after first sync" mean exactly that — finish the TODO.
- `skills/.external/` is gitignored. Reproducibility lives in
  `registry.yaml`. Never commit sync output.
- Sources may need multiple entries when upstream scatters skills
  across paths (see `vercel-labs/agent-browser` at both `skills/` and
  `skill-data/`).

## Gotchas

- Editing `index.yaml` by hand fails `check-index-drift`. Let
  pre-commit regenerate it via `scripts/generate-index.sh`.
- Writing a SKILL.md > 500 lines fails `check-frontmatter`. Extract
  to `references/mode-*.md` before the gate catches it.
- Adding a hardcoded `/Users/<name>/` outside `harnesses/claude/` or
  `.claude/hooks` fails `check-portable-paths`. Use
  `$HOME`/`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` instead.
- Describing seed/tailor installs as "copy into `.claude/skills/`"
  fails `check-harness-install-paths`. Use "shared skill root" + a
  bridge clause.
- Inlining `dagger call check` or direct bench-agent dispatch in
  `skills/deliver/SKILL.md` fails `check-deliver-composition`. Compose
  via `/ci`, `/code-review`, `/qa`, etc.
- Writing `claim_acquire` / `claim_release` / `claims.sh` under
  `skills/` fails `check-no-claims`. These were dropped per 032.
- Scripts that `source $REPO_ROOT/…` or `../../…` break the moment the
  skill is symlink-installed into a foreign repo. Use `$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/`.
- Anchoring a new mechanism on one harness's runtime feature is the
  Red Line violation. Primary layer is filesystem + SKILL.md.
- Adding `disable-model-invocation: true` to a skill makes it
  user-only. The two global skills (`tailor`, `seed`) rely on model
  invocation in consuming repos — don't break them accidentally.
- `harnesses/claude/settings.json` changes only take effect after
  `./bootstrap.sh` re-runs. Symlinked configs propagate instantly;
  this one doesn't.
- `skills/.external/` is per-machine state. Don't write skills that
  depend on a specific external being present — `registry.yaml` is
  the contract, not a runtime guarantee.
- Writing `references/spellbook.md` or any `references/<repo>.md`
  sidecar is the forbidden sewn-on-sleeve pattern. Put repo-specific
  content in SKILL.md body.
- Regexes over agent prose and semantic workflow DSLs wrapped around
  general-purpose agents are strong smells. If the harness is parsing
  free-form agent output with regex, the boundary is wrong.

## Evaluation loop

`/harness eval` spawns matched baseline + with-skill sub-agents on a
representative prompt, then a critic sub-agent compares. Marginal
improvement means delete the skill — the description tax isn't free
(~100 tokens per skill × every conversation). Eval prompts live at
`skills/<name>/evals/` in the skill dir and rerun after changes. See
`references/mode-eval.md`.
