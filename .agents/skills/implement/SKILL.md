description: |
  Atomic TDD build skill for the Spellbook repo. Takes a context packet
  (shaped ticket from /shape or backlog.d/<id>-*.md) and produces code +
  tests on a feature branch. Red -> Green -> Refactor. "Green" here
  means `dagger call check --source=.` exits 0 — the 12-gate load-bearing
  gate. Does not shape, review, QA, or ship — single concern: spec to
  green gate. Use when: "implement this spec", "build this", "TDD this",
  after /shape has produced a context packet.
  Trigger: /implement, /build (alias).

# /implement

Spec in, green gate out. One packet, one feature branch, one concern.

## Invariants

- Trust the context packet. Do not reshape. Do not re-plan.
- If the packet is incomplete, **fail loudly** — do not invent the spec.
- The green signal is `dagger call check --source=.`. Every other test
  command (pytest, bun test, shellcheck) is a sub-gate of that one gate.
- Cross-harness parity is a Red Line. If the change touches
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, it works on Claude, Codex, AND Pi.

## Contract

**Input.** A context packet: goal, non-goals, constraints, repo anchors,
oracle (executable preferred), implementation sequence. Resolution order:

1. Explicit path argument (`/implement backlog.d/033-foo.md`)
2. Backlog item ID (`/implement 033`) -> resolves via `backlog.d/<id>-*.md`
3. Last `/shape` output in the current session
4. **No packet found -> stop.** Do not guess the spec from a title.

Required packet fields (hard gate — missing any = stop):
- `goal` (one sentence, testable)
- `oracle` (how we know it's done, ideally executable commands)
- `implementation sequence` (ordered steps, or explicit "single chunk")

See `references/context-packet.md` for the full shape.

**Output.**
- Code + tests on a feature branch (`<type>/<slug>` from current branch;
  `<type>` in `{feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor}`; base is `master`)
- `dagger call check --source=.` exits 0 (all 12 sub-gates green)
- Working tree clean (no debug prints, no scratch files)
- Commits in repo convention — one logical unit per commit, semantic
  prefix matching current branch type
- Final message: branch ref + oracle checklist status + gate receipt

**Stops at:** green gate + clean tree. Does not run `/code-review`,
`/qa`, `/ci`, or open a PR. Those are `/deliver`'s orchestration.

## The green signal, concretely

`dagger call check --source=.` is the one command. It fans out to 12
parallel sub-gates (from the repo brief):

| Sub-gate | Triggered by changes to |
|---|---|
| `lint-yaml` | any `*.yaml` / `*.yml` |
| `lint-shell` | any non-`ci/` shell script (shellcheck --severity=error) |
| `lint-python` | any non-`ci/` `.py` (py_compile) |
| `check-frontmatter` | `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `agents/*.md` |
| `check-index-drift` | `skills/`, `agents/` (compares against `scripts/generate-index.sh`) |
| `check-vendored-copies` | content that has canonical-vs-copy pairs |
| `test-bun` | `skills/research/` TypeScript modules |
| `check-exclusions` | source files (no `@ts-ignore`, `.skip()`, `eslint-disable`, `as any`) |
| `check-portable-paths` | anything outside `harnesses/claude/` + `.claude/hooks` (no `/Users/<name>/`, `C:\Users\`) |
| `check-harness-install-paths` | `skills/seed/`, `skills/tailor/` (install logic must not be Claude-only) |
| `check-deliver-composition` | `skills/deliver/SKILL.md` (must compose atomic phase skills via trigger syntax) |
| `check-no-claims` | anything under `skills/` (no `claims.sh`, `claim_acquire`, `claim_release`) |

The faster inner-loop commands (before the full gate):

- **Python modules in `ci/`**: `cd ci && python -m pytest tests/test_<name>.py`
  then `cd ci && python -m pytest tests/` for regression. Module under
  test: e.g. `ci/src/spellbook_ci/heal_support.py`.
- **TypeScript in `skills/research/`**: `cd skills/research && bun test`
  (mirrors `test-bun`).
- **Shell scripts under `scripts/` or `.githooks/`**: invoke directly
  against a fixture, then `dagger call lint-shell --source=.`. Prior
  art: `.githooks/test_pre_merge_commit.sh`.
- **Frontmatter / lint-only SKILL.md edits**: `dagger call
  check-frontmatter --source=.` + (if editing `/deliver`)
  `dagger call check-deliver-composition --source=.` + (if editing
  `skills/seed/` or `skills/tailor/` install code)
  `dagger call check-harness-install-paths --source=.`.

On a lint-style gate failure (`lint-yaml`, `lint-shell`, `lint-python`,
`check-frontmatter`) that blocks you after a targeted fix, the bounded
repair path is `dagger call heal --source=. --model=gpt-4.1
--attempts=2`. `HEALABLE_GATES` in `ci/src/spellbook_ci/heal_support.py`
is the source of truth for what heal can touch — do not ask it to fix
anything else.

## Workflow

### 1. Load and validate packet

Resolve the packet (order above). Parse required fields. If any are
missing or vague ("add feature X" with no oracle), stop with:

> Packet incomplete: missing <field>. Run /shape first.

Do not try to fill in the gaps. Shape is a different skill's judgment.

### 2. Create the feature branch

`git checkout -b <type>/<slug>` from the current branch. Builders never
commit to `master`. If you forget, create the branch after and
cherry-pick before handing off. Branch naming follows the brief:
`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `docs/*`, `refactor/*`.

### 3. Dispatch the builder

Spawn a **builder** sub-agent (general-purpose) with:
- The full context packet
- The executable oracle, with `dagger call check --source=.` as the
  final gate
- The TDD mandate (see below)
- The relevant test surface (Python? `ci/tests/`. TypeScript? `skills/research/__tests__/`.
  Shell? a sibling `test_<script>.sh`. Markdown-only skill? Dagger
  frontmatter + composition gates)
- File ownership (if the packet decomposes into disjoint chunks, spawn
  multiple builders in parallel — one per chunk, each with subset of
  oracle)

**Builder prompt must include:**
> You MUST write a failing test before production code. RED -> GREEN ->
> REFACTOR -> COMMIT. Exceptions: config files, generated code, UI
> layout, and markdown-only SKILL.md content whose test is `dagger call
> check-frontmatter` + `check-index-drift`. Document any skipped-TDD
> step inline in the commit message.

See `references/tdd-loop.md` for the full cycle and skip rules.

### 4. Verify exit conditions

Before exiting, confirm (run the commands — don't trust the builder):

- [ ] Every oracle command exits 0
- [ ] `dagger call check --source=.` exits 0 (all 12 sub-gates)
- [ ] Pre-commit hook exits 0 on the last commit (it regenerates
  `index.yaml` and runs `check-harness-agnostic-installs.sh`). If
  `index.yaml` was regenerated, the hook's amend counts as a success
  signal.
- [ ] `git status` clean (no untracked debug files; `.spellbook/deliver/<ulid>/`
  state/receipt files are gitignored and MUST NOT be force-added)
- [ ] No `TODO`/`FIXME`/`console.log`/`print("here")` added that isn't
  in the spec
- [ ] Commits are logically atomic (one concern per commit), semantic
  prefix matches branch type

If any check fails, dispatch a builder sub-agent to fix. Max 2 fix
loops, then escalate. Lint-only failures may escalate to `dagger call
heal` if they match `HEALABLE_GATES`.

### 5. Hand off

Output:
- Feature branch name
- Commit list (with semantic prefixes)
- Oracle checklist (which commands passed)
- `dagger call check --source=.` receipt (pass/fail per sub-gate)
- Residual risks

Do not run review, do not merge, do not push unless the packet
explicitly says so. The flywheel's outer loop pushes; builders don't.

## Scoping judgment (what the model must decide)

- **Test granularity.** One behavior per test. If you can't name the
  behavior in one short sentence, the test is too big. Examples in
  `ci/tests/test_heal_support.py`: `test_returns_all_failed_gate_details`,
  `test_rejects_unsupported_gate`, `test_commit_message_is_semantic`.
- **When to skip TDD.** Config, generated code, UI layout, pure
  exploration, and markdown-only SKILL.md content where the test is
  the Dagger frontmatter/composition gate. Document the skip in the
  commit message. Everything executable: test first.
- **When to escalate.** Builder loops on the same test failure 3+
  times, the oracle contradicts the constraints, the spec requires
  behavior that violates an invariant (cross-harness parity, skill
  self-containment, `.spellbook/deliver/` state hygiene, no-claims),
  or `dagger call heal` can't touch the failing gate. Stop and report.
- **Parallelism.** Only parallelize when file ownership is disjoint
  and oracle criteria partition cleanly. Shared SKILL.md, shared
  `ci/src/spellbook_ci/main.py` -> serial builders.
- **Refactor depth.** The refactor step in TDD is local — improve the
  code you just wrote. Broader refactors are `/refactor`'s job.

## What /implement does NOT do

- Pick tickets (caller's job, or `/deliver` / `/flywheel`)
- Shape or re-shape specs (-> `/shape`)
- Code review (-> `/code-review`)
- QA against a running app (-> `/qa`; this repo has no runtime app, so
  `/qa` is typically skipped)
- CI gate orchestration beyond running `dagger call check` (-> `/ci`)
- Simplification passes beyond TDD refactor (-> `/refactor`)
- Ship, merge, deploy (-> human, or `/settle`)
- Edit `index.yaml` (pre-commit regenerates it; manual edits are drift)
- Re-bootstrap harnesses after editing `harnesses/claude/settings.json`
  (call out the need in the hand-off; the operator re-runs `bootstrap.sh`)

## Stopping conditions

Stop with a loud report if:
- Packet is incomplete or ambiguous
- Oracle is unverifiable (prose-only checkboxes with no executable form —
  write one, or stop)
- Builder fails the same test 3+ times after targeted fix attempts
- Spec contradicts a stated invariant (cross-harness parity,
  self-containment, no-claims, `/deliver` composition, `.spellbook/deliver/`
  state hygiene)
- `dagger call check` fails a gate outside `HEALABLE_GATES` after two
  targeted builder fixes
- Tests hit an external dependency that isn't available (e.g. Dagger
  engine down; `bun` missing for `skills/research/`)

**Not** stopping conditions: spec is hard, unfamiliar codebase, initial
tests red, `dagger call heal` needed once. Those are the job.

## Gotchas

- **Reshaping inside /implement.** If the spec is wrong, stop. Don't
  silently rewrite the oracle to match what you built.
- **Declaring victory without the full gate.** "pytest passes" is not
  green — `dagger call check --source=.` is. Frontmatter, portable
  paths, harness install paths, `/deliver` composition, and `no-claims`
  fail in ways unit tests never see.
- **Editing `index.yaml` by hand.** Pre-commit regenerates it from
  `skills/` + `agents/`. A manual edit either churns on next commit or
  drifts silently.
- **Touching `harnesses/claude/settings.json` without flagging re-bootstrap.**
  Bootstrap COPIES this file (Claude mutates it at runtime). Changes
  require re-bootstrap to take effect; call it out in the hand-off.
- **Force-adding `.spellbook/deliver/<ulid>/(state|receipt).json`.**
  The pre-commit hook blocks this. It's gitignored for a reason — agent
  state, not repo content.
- **Introducing claim primitives under `skills/`.** `claims.sh`,
  `claim_acquire`, `claim_release` are dropped per backlog.d/032; the
  `check-no-claims` gate regresses on reintroduction.
- **Anchoring new behavior on one harness's feature.** Cross-harness
  parity is a Red Line. If you can't answer "what does this do on
  Codex and Pi?" the design is incomplete — raise a blocker.
- **Skills sourcing `../..` or `$REPO_ROOT/...`.** Self-containment
  invariant: libs resolve via `readlink -f` + `$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/...`.
  State roots anchor to the *invoking* project's `git rev-parse
  --show-toplevel`, not the skill's install dir.
- **Inlining phase logic in `skills/deliver/SKILL.md`.** `/deliver`
  must compose via trigger syntax (`/code-review`, `/ci`, `/qa`,
  `/implement`, `/refactor`, `/shape`). Raw `dagger call check`,
  `bunx playwright`, or direct bench-agent dispatch inside
  `skills/deliver/SKILL.md` fails `check-deliver-composition`.
- **Silent catch-and-return.** New code that swallows exceptions and
  returns fallbacks is hiding bugs. Fail loud. Test the failure mode.
  See `select_healable_failure` in `ci/src/spellbook_ci/heal_support.py`
  — raises on unsupported gate, not a silent skip.
- **Testing implementation, not behavior.** Tests that assert the
  structure of the code break on every refactor. Test what the code
  does from the outside.
- **Committing debug noise.** `console.log`, `print("here")`,
  commented-out code. The tree must be clean before exit.
- **Skipping TDD without documenting.** Config and generated code are
  fine exceptions; silently skipping because "it was simpler" is not.
- **Parallelizing coupled builders.** Two builders editing
  `skills/tailor/SKILL.md` and `skills/deliver/SKILL.md` simultaneously
  when they cross-reference = merge pain. Partition by file ownership.
- **Branch drift.** Forgetting to create the feature branch and
  committing to `master`. Always `git checkout -b` first.
- **Trusting self-reported success.** Builders say "all tests pass."
  Run `dagger call check --source=.` yourself. Agents lie
  (accidentally).
