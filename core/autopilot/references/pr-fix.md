# /pr-fix

Take a PR from blocked to actually mergeable.

## Role

Senior engineer unblocking a PR. Think like an owner, not a task runner.

## Objective

Take PR `$ARGUMENTS` (or the current branch PR) to this state:
- no merge conflicts
- required CI green
- self-review complete
- every actionable review item handled
- no open review threads
- no misleading "PR Unblocked" comment while review automation can still add findings
- durable PR evidence still truthful after the last fix or push

## Latitude

- Use judgment on whether feedback should be fixed now, deferred, or rejected.
- Prefer deterministic tooling for exact inventory and state checks.
- Prefer model reasoning for semantic triage, scope decisions, and reviewer synthesis.

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

1. **Read every comment.** Use `gh` to fetch PR reviews, inline comments, and issue comments. Read every body. Classify each as actionable or not. There is no shortcut, no summary endpoint, no wrapper script — just read the comments.
2. **Reply per item.** Aggregate "covered above" comments are not enough for actionable review findings.
3. **Settle async reviewers before signaling success.** After every push, `gh pr ready`, or any action that can retrigger bots, rerun the inventory after reviewer activity settles.
4. **No quality-gate downgrades.** Fix the code or the tests. Do not weaken thresholds.
5. **Evidence must stay current.** If a fix changes behavior, verification, or review confidence, refresh the walkthrough and reviewer evidence before signaling success.

## Dependency Order

Conflicts -> CI -> Self-Review -> Review Reconciliation -> Settlement -> Signal

## Core Workflow

Read [pr-fix-workflow.md](./pr-fix-workflow.md) and execute the phases in order:
- assess the PR and list blockers
- resolve conflicts first
- fix CI before arguing with reviewers
- self-review the diff
- read every review comment and build a reconciliation ledger
- reconcile every actionable item with a decision and direct reply
- push, reread comments, and reconcile again
- wait for async reviewers to settle
- update the PR body if the implementation or evidence changed
- only then post the unblocked summary

`dogfood`, `agent-browser`, and `browser-use` are available for user-flow verification when the diff is user-facing.

## Hard Stop Rules

Do not post `PR Unblocked` if any of these are still true:
- required CI is failing
- review-related checks are `QUEUED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `PENDING`
- any actionable review item lacks a decision
- any actionable PR review comment lacks a direct reply
- any actionable review thread remains unresolved
- the post-settlement inventory changed and has not been reconciled
- the PR walkthrough or reviewer evidence is stale, text-only, or no longer proves the current branch state

## Retry Policy

Max 2 full-pipeline retries when one phase breaks another. After 2, stop and summarize clearly for the user.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating `mergeable=MERGEABLE` as proof the PR is review-clean
- Posting `PR Unblocked` before reviewer settlement
- Using counts without reconciling individual comment ids
- Replying with one aggregate comment instead of per-finding responses
- Resolving threads without verifying the code actually matches the reply
- Ignoring older comments because newer checks are green
- Trusting prior "fixed" or "unblocked" comments without rebuilding the inventory

## Output

Summarize:
- blockers found
- phases executed
- CI fixes applied
- review items fixed / deferred / rejected
- final check status
- explicit confirmation that the review inventory is closed
