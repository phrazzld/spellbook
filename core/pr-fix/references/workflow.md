# Workflow

Use this reference for the ordered `/pr-fix` execution path.

## 1. Assess

Read the PR, the linked issue, and the current check state. Understand what the branch is trying to do before touching conflicts or reviews.

```bash
gh pr view $PR --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,isDraft
gh pr checks $PR --json name,state,startedAt,completedAt,link
gh pr view $PR --json body --jq '.body | split("\n")[:80] | join("\n")'
BASE="$(gh pr view $PR --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)"
git fetch origin "$BASE"
```

Build a short blocker list:
- conflicts
- failing checks
- open review threads
- actionable bot issue comments
- pending review automation

## 2. Resolve Conflicts

Skip if `mergeable != CONFLICTING`.

Rebase onto base and resolve semantically. Preserve the PR's behavior; integrate upstream structure.

```bash
git rebase "origin/$BASE"
```

Verify locally before moving on.

## 3. Fix CI

Skip if required checks already pass.

Push the current branch, inspect failing jobs, classify the failure, and fix root cause.

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
gh run list --limit 5 --json databaseId,workflowName,status,conclusion,headBranch
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed | tail -n 200
```

If the CI fix creates conflicts, return to step 2.

## 4. Self-Review the Diff

Always do this, even when CI is green.

```bash
BASE="$(gh pr view $PR --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName)"
git diff "origin/$BASE"...HEAD
```

Look for:
- dead code
- logic bugs
- wasted computation
- wrong log levels
- semantic mismatches between names, comments, and behavior

Fix what you find. Re-run the relevant verification before moving on.

## 5. Build the Review Inventory

Read [reconciliation-ledger.md](./reconciliation-ledger.md) and use the inventory script.

```bash
python3 scripts/review_inventory.py $PR > /tmp/pr-fix-review-inventory.json
```

From that inventory, build a working ledger of actionable items across:
- GraphQL review threads
- REST PR review comments
- REST issue comments from bots

For each actionable item, record:
- source
- comment or thread id
- author
- classification: `bug | risk | style | question`
- severity: `critical | high | medium | low`
- decision: `fix now | defer | reject`
- reply status
- thread status

Do not continue while any actionable item lacks a decision.

## 6. Address the Ledger

For each actionable item:
- **fix now**: write the fix, verify it, commit it
- **defer**: create or link a follow-up issue, then reply publicly
- **reject**: reply publicly with reasoning

For every actionable PR review comment:
- reply directly on that thread
- include classification, severity, decision, change, and verification

For every actionable bot issue comment:
- reply explicitly; do not rely on a summary comment elsewhere on the PR

For every actionable review thread:
- resolve it after replying

If a new push or `gh pr ready` retriggers reviewers, the ledger is stale. Rebuild it.

## 7. Verify, Push, and Reconcile Again

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

After any push, rerun the review inventory and reconcile again. Do not assume previously closed gaps stayed closed.

If a review fix breaks CI, go back to step 3.

## 8. Dogfood User-Facing Changes

If the fixes touch UI or user behavior:
- run `/dogfood http://localhost:3000`
- fix P0/P1 findings
- rerun on affected scope

Skip only when the diff is fully internal.

## 9. Settlement Gate

Before signaling success:
- wait for review automation triggered by your last action to settle
- rerun the review inventory after settlement
- verify the ledger is still fully reconciled

Treat these as review automation unless you know the repo says otherwise:
- `CodeRabbit`
- `Greptile`
- `Cerberus`
- `Gemini`
- `Claude`
- `Codex`
- checks named like `review / ...`

Do **not** post `PR Unblocked` while review-related checks are still `QUEUED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `PENDING`.

If the repo is known to post delayed findings even after checks complete, require one more quiet poll with no new review items before signaling success.

## 10. Refresh PR Description

If the fix materially changes implementation, evidence, or merge risk, update the PR body and walkthrough.

Before editing, read `../pr/references/pr-body-template.md`.

Refresh:
- `Why This Matters`
- `Trade-offs / Risks`
- `What Changed`
- `Before / After`
- `Walkthrough`

## 11. Signal

Only after the settlement gate passes, post the PR summary comment:

```bash
gh pr comment $PR --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## PR Unblocked

**Conflicts**: [resolved N files / none]
**CI**: [green / was: failure type]
**Reviews**: [N fixed, N deferred (#issue), N rejected]
**Open Threads**: 0
**Review Automation**: settled

Ready for re-review.
EOF
)"
```

If the settlement gate fails, do not post this comment.
