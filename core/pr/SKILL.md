# /pr

Open a pull request from current branch state.

## Role

Engineer shipping clean, well-documented PRs.

## Objective

Create a draft PR from current branch. Link to issue, explain what/why/how.

## Latitude

- Stage and commit any uncommitted changes with semantic message
- Read linked issue from branch name or recent commits
- Write PR body that explains decisions, not just changes

## PR Body Requirements (MANDATORY)

Every PR body must contain all six sections. A PR missing any section is not ready.

```
## Summary
What changed and why it matters. Not a diff recap — explain the significance.
Link to the issue. State the problem this solves or the capability this adds.

## Changes
Concise list of what was done. Reference key files/functions.

## Acceptance Criteria
Copied or derived from the linked issue. Checkboxes.

## Manual QA
Step-by-step instructions a reviewer can follow to verify the change works.
Include: setup steps, exact commands, expected output, URLs to visit.

## What Changed

Mermaid diagram showing the nature of the change. Selection:

| Change type | Diagram |
|------------|---------|
| New feature / component | `graph TD` of new components and their relationships |
| Bug fix | `stateDiagram-v2` showing broken state → fixed state |
| Refactor | `graph TD` before vs. after (two diagrams, labeled Before/After) |
| Data model change | `erDiagram` of affected tables/relations |
| API change | `sequenceDiagram` of old vs. new call flow |
| Simple/internal change | Omit — don't force a diagram when it adds no signal |

**Decision rule:** If the change can be explained in one sentence with no branching or relationships → omit. Otherwise → include.

Load `~/.claude/skills/visualize/references/github-mermaid-patterns.md` for annotated examples and GitHub gotchas.

## Before / After
Show the state before and after this PR. MANDATORY for every PR.

**Text**: Describe the previous behavior/state and the new behavior/state.
**Screenshots**: Include before and after screenshots for any user-facing change
(UI, CLI output, error messages, dashboards). Use `![before](url)` / `![after](url)`.

Skip screenshots ONLY when the change is purely internal (no visible output difference).
When in doubt, screenshot.

## Test Coverage
Pointers to specific test files and test functions that cover this change.
Note any gaps: what ISN'T tested and why.
```

## Workflow

1. **Clean** — Commit any uncommitted changes with semantic message
2. **Context** — Read linked issue, diff branch against main, identify relevant tests
3. **Visual QA** — If diff touches frontend files (`app/`, `components/`, `*.css`), run `/visual-qa`. Fix any P0/P1 issues before opening PR. Capture screenshots for Before/After section.
4. **Dogfood QA** — Run `/dogfood http://localhost:3000` (start dev server first if not running).
   Fix all P0/P1 issues found. Iterate until clean. **Do not open a PR until this passes.**
   Include dogfood summary (issues found, fixed) in PR body under Manual QA section.
5. **Describe** — Title from issue, body follows PR Body Requirements above (capture before state FIRST, before making changes if possible)
6. **Before/After** — Use screenshots from visual QA + dogfood steps. For non-UI changes, describe behavioral difference in text.
7. **Open** — `gh pr create --draft --assignee phrazzld`
8. **Comment** — Add context comment if notable decisions were made
9. **Retro** — If this PR closes a GitHub issue, append implementation feedback:
   ```
   /retro append --issue $ISSUE --predicted {effort_label} --actual {actual_effort} \
     --scope "{what_changed_from_spec}" --blocker "{blockers}" --pattern "{insight}"
   ```
   This feeds the grooming feedback loop — `/groom` reads retro.md to calibrate
   future effort estimates and issue scoping.

## Comment Style

Like a colleague leaving context for future-you:
- **Concise** — No fluff
- **High-context** — Reference files, functions, decisions
- **Useful** — What's not obvious from the diff?
- **Human** — Some wit welcome

## Output

PR URL. Retro entry appended to `.groom/retro.md` (if issue-linked).
