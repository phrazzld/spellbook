# Research

Retrieval-first research, multi-AI orchestration, and expert validation.

## Absorbed Skills

This skill consolidates: `web-search`, `delegate`, `thinktank`, `introspect`.

## Routing

### Explicit sub-capability (user names one)

If first argument matches a keyword, route directly to that reference:

| Keyword | Reference |
|---------|-----------|
| `web-search`, `web-deep`, `web-news`, `web-docs` | `references/web-search.md` |
| `delegate` | `references/delegate.md` |
| `thinktank` | `references/thinktank.md` |
| `introspect` | `references/introspect.md` |
| `readwise` | `references/readwise.md` |
| `xai` | `references/xai-search.md` |

### No sub-capability (default): PARALLEL FANOUT

**When no keyword is specified, fan out to multiple sources in parallel.**
Research means gathering signal from many vantage points simultaneously.
The routing table is a dispatch list, not a switch statement.

For any research question, launch these in parallel (via Agent tool):

1. **Web search** (Exa/WebSearch) — current docs, implementations, pricing, APIs
2. **Thinktank** (`./thinktank "question" --quick --perspectives 3`) — multi-model expert perspectives
3. **xAI** — social signal, what practitioners are saying (when relevant)
4. **Codebase search** (Grep/Glob) — what the project already does (when relevant)

Then **synthesize** across all results: consensus, conflicts, citations, recommendations.

Only narrow to a single source when:
- The user explicitly names one (e.g., "/research web-search [query]")
- The question is trivially answerable by one source (e.g., "what version is X?")

## Use When

- Before implementing any system >200 LOC (reference architecture search)
- Before choosing a library, framework, or approach (current best practices)
- When training data may be stale (model releases, API changes, deprecations)
- When you need to verify a fact before asserting it
- When the user asks about something outside the codebase
- During `/groom` architecture critique (reference implementations)
- During `/shape` technical exploration (how others solve this)
- During `/build` understand step (existing patterns and examples)
- When another skill says "web search first" or "research before implementing"

## Decision Framework

**If you're about to assert something from training data that could be wrong,
invoke `/research web-search` first.** The cost of a search is negligible;
the cost of hallucination is high.

This applies especially to:
- Model names and versions (stale within months)
- Library APIs and best practices (change with major versions)
- Pricing, availability, feature comparisons
- Security advisories, CVEs, deprecation notices

## Provider Routing

| Query Type | Primary Provider | Why |
|------------|-----------------|-----|
| Code examples, reference implementations | Exa (code context) | Finds actual code, not blog posts |
| Academic papers, formal specs | Exa (search) | Strong academic indexing |
| Library/framework docs | Context7 | Semantic doc search |
| Current events, model releases | Exa (with recency filter) | Real-time indexing |
| Social sentiment, public discourse, trending | xAI X Search | Real-time X/Twitter data |
| Web pages with image/video analysis | xAI Web Search | Grounded web + multimodal |
| General knowledge fallback | WebSearch / Brave | Broad coverage |

**Exa-first** for code and technical content. **xAI for social/real-time pulse.**
Default to Exa unless the query is clearly better suited to another provider.
Use xAI X Search for "what are people saying about", sentiment, discourse,
trending topics. Use xAI Web Search when you need grounded web results with
optional image understanding. See `references/xai-search.md` for API details.

## Anti-Patterns

- Asserting model versions from training data without searching
- Using WebSearch for code examples (Exa code context is better)
- Skipping research because "I'm pretty sure" (you're not)
- Research without citations (every claim needs a URL)
