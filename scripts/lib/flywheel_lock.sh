# Single-instance lock for /flywheel.

# Content:   {"pid": <int>, "cycle_id": "<ulid>", "started_at": "<iso8601 UTC>"}
#
# Two /flywheel processes in the same worktree would race on event log +
# bucket updates. We keep a filesystem lock (not a git ref) because it's
# machine-local state, and we steal stale locks when the owning pid is dead
# so a SIGKILL'd cycle doesn't wedge the worktree forever.
#
# Usage:
#   source scripts/lib/flywheel_lock.sh
#   flywheel_acquire <cycle_id>   # 0 on success, 1 if another live cycle holds it
#   flywheel_release <cycle_id>   # 0 on success (idempotent); 1 if cycle_id mismatch

# exactly one creator across concurrent callers, eliminating the TOCTOU race
# where two stealers both pass "kill -0" and both rename on top of each other.
