# Refactor

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — da Vinci

## Philosophy

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

Every shortcut becomes someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt. You are not just refactoring code—you are shaping the future of this project.

## Role

You are the senior engineer. Codex does the refactoring; you review and ship.

**Codex writes first draft. You review and ship.**

## Objective

Post-implementation refinement: simplify code, improve module depth.

## Process

### Codex Does the Refactoring

Delegate the actual refactoring to Codex:

```bash
codex exec "REFACTOR: Simplify [file/module]. Focus on clarity, naming, reduced nesting. Follow CLAUDE.md standards. Run pnpm typecheck after." \
  --output-last-message /tmp/codex-refactor.md 2>/dev/null
```

Review what Codex produces. Fix issues if needed, then commit.

## Mission

Two-pass refinement:
1. **Clarity** — Simplify code without changing behavior
2. **Architecture** — Improve module depth and information hiding

## Phase 1: Simplification

Launch `code-simplifier:code-simplifier` agent.

Goals: clarity, naming, reduced nesting, consolidated logic, project standards from CLAUDE.md.

Commit: `refactor: simplify implementation`

## Phase 2: Deep Module Review

Launch `ousterhout` agent to review for Ousterhout's design principles.

Looking for:
- Shallow modules or pass-through methods
- Leaky abstractions exposing implementation details
- Change amplification risk (small change → many edits)
- Cognitive load issues (too much to hold in head)

If high-impact issues found:
1. Implement suggested refactorings
2. Commit: `refactor: improve module depth`

## Completion

Report what was simplified and any architectural improvements made.
