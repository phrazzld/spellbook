  Mid-session harness postmortem. When the agent makes a wrong decision,

# /calibrate

The agent made a mistake. Don't fix the code — fix WHY the agent wrote wrong code. Then fix the code.

## Core Invariant

```
DO NOT fix the original code until the harness is fixed.
```

Fixing code first means you forget to fix the harness. The whole point is amortizing the improvement so this class of mistake never recurs.

## Process

### 1. Pause

Stop current work. Capture:
- **What happened:** What did the agent do wrong?
- **What was expected:** What should it have done?
- **Impact:** How bad was the mistake? (cosmetic → data loss)

### 2. Load Context

Load diagnostic skills if installed (check with `/focus list`):
- `harness-engineering` — feedback loop hierarchy, mechanical enforcement
- `context-engineering` — instruction design, context lifecycle
- `llm-infrastructure` — prompt audit, model routing, eval patterns

Invoke `/research web-search` if the mistake involves stale API knowledge, wrong library usage, or outdated patterns.

### 3. Diagnose

Trace the decision back through the context chain. Ask each question:

| Layer | Question |
|-------|----------|
| AGENTS.md | Did it address this? Was the instruction ambiguous? |
| Skills | Were loaded skills misleading or incomplete? |
| References | Were referenced docs stale or wrong? |
| Hooks/lints | Should a mechanical check have caught this? |
| Types | Could the type system have prevented this? |
| Tests | Would a test have caught this before it mattered? |
| Memory | Was a user preference or project context missing? |
| Model knowledge | Did the model hallucinate or use stale knowledge? |

Use harness-engineering's feedback loop hierarchy to identify which level failed.

### 4. Classify

What level SHOULD have prevented this? Ordered by reliability:

```
Type system     — compile-time, highest reliability
Lint rule       — edit-time, catches patterns
Hook            — pre-edit/pre-commit, mechanical prevention
Test            — run-time, catches behavior
CI              — push-time, catches integration
Skill/reference — wrong workflow instructions
AGENTS.md       — missing or wrong convention
Memory          — missing user preference or project context
```

Always fix at the highest reliable level that applies. A hook beats an AGENTS.md rule. A type beats a hook.

### 5. Fix the Harness

Apply the fix. Use context-engineering principles:
- Clear, unambiguous language
- Progressive disclosure (don't bloat top-level instructions)
- Instruction hierarchy (most critical first)
- "Use when" clauses so fixes are discoverable

Codification targets (same cascade as `/reflect`):

| Target | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Hook | Harness config (e.g. settings.json + hooks/) |
| Lint rule | Project lint config |
| Type | Source code type definitions |
| Test | Test suite |
| CI | CI config |
| Skill | Project-local skills dir (if spellbook-managed, also log upstream) |
| AGENTS.md | Project or global AGENTS.md |
| Memory | Harness memory system |

### 6. Verify

Confirm the harness fix would have prevented the original mistake:
- Re-read the new instruction/hook/lint/type — is it unambiguous?
- Mental replay: given this fix, would the agent have made the right call?
- If mechanical (hook/lint/type/test): run it and confirm it catches the case.

### 7. Resume

NOW fix the original code, with the improved harness in place.

The code fix should be trivial now — the hard work was diagnosing and fixing the harness.

## Relationship to Other Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `/reflect` | End-of-session retrospective. Calibrate is mid-session, blocks work until harness is fixed. |
| `/debug` | Diagnoses code bugs. Calibrate diagnoses agent decision-making context. |
| `/land` | After calibrate fixes harness + code, settle can polish the PR. |
| `/focus` | Search for diagnostic skills via `/focus search`. |
| `/research` | Web search for stale knowledge gaps. |

## Anti-Patterns

- Fixing the code first ("I'll update the instructions later" — you won't)
- Adding an AGENTS.md rule when a hook/lint/type would be more reliable
- Over-codifying: not every mistake needs a new rule — sometimes it's a one-off
- Vague instructions: "be careful with X" instead of a specific, testable rule
- Skipping verification: the fix must demonstrably prevent recurrence

## Spellbook Feedback Loop

When the fix target is a Spellbook-managed skill (has `.spellbook` marker),
the improvement should flow back to the canonical source.

See `references/spellbook-feedback-loop.md` for the full push/observe workflow.

**Quick log:** `scripts/log_observation.py --primitive NAME --type TYPE --summary TEXT --context TEXT --confidence FLOAT`

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/log_observation.py` | Append observation to `.spellbook/observations.ndjson` |

## Output
