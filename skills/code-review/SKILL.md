  Parallel multi-agent code review. Launch reviewer team, synthesize findings,
  auto-fix blocking issues, loop until clean.
  Use when: "review this", "code review", "is this ready to ship",
  "check this code", "review my changes".
  Trigger: /code-review, /review, /critique.

# /code-review

Multi-provider, multi-harness code review. You are the marshal — read the diff,
select reviewers, craft prompts, dispatch everything in parallel, synthesize
results, fix blockers, loop until clean.

## Marshal Protocol

1. **Read the diff.** `git diff $BASE...HEAD` (default base: `main` or `master`).
   Classify: what changed? (API, UI, tests, infra, security, perf, data model, etc.)

2. **Select internal reviewers (static map).** Do NOT hand-pick. Run the
   selection algorithm in `references/bench-map.yaml`:
   - `git diff --name-only $BASE...HEAD` → changed files
   - Start from `default`; union `add` agents for every rule whose glob
     matches any changed file; de-dupe; cap at 5 (critic pinned)
   - Bench size always in [3, 5]; selection is deterministic per diff
   Read `references/bench-map.md` for the full algorithm and
   `references/internal-bench.md` for each agent's lens. Then craft a
   tailored prompt per selected reviewer.

3. **Dispatch all three tiers in parallel:**

   | Tier | What | How |
   |------|------|-----|
   | Internal bench | 3-5 Explore sub-agents with philosophy lenses | Agent tool, tailored prompts |
   | Thinktank review | 10 agents, 8 model providers | `thinktank review` CLI. See `references/thinktank-review.md` |
   | Cross-harness | Codex + Gemini CLIs (skip whichever you are) | See `references/cross-harness.md` |

   Thinktank-specific rule: wait for the process to exit, or for
   `trace/summary.json` to reach `complete` or `degraded` with a
   `run_completed` event in `trace/events.jsonl`, before you consume the run.
   Mid-run output directories are not final artifacts.

4. **Synthesize.** Collect all outputs. Deduplicate findings across tiers.
   Rank by severity: blocking (correctness, security) > important (architecture,
   testing) > advisory (style, naming).

5. **Verdict.** If no blocking findings → **Ship**. If blocking findings exist →
   fix loop (below).

## Fix Loop

For each blocking finding, spawn a **builder** sub-agent with the specific
file:line and fix instruction. Builders fix strategically (Ousterhout) and
simply (grug). Builder fixes, runs tests, commits.

After all fixes land, **re-dispatch all three review tiers.** Full re-review,
not a spot-check. Loop until no blocking findings remain. Max 3 iterations —
escalate to human if still blocked.

## Live Verification

**Trigger:** the diff touches user-facing patterns — `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `pages/`,
`app/`, `routes/`, `api/`, `endpoints/`, or component directories.

**Rule:** at least one reviewer must exercise the affected routes/components.
**Ship** verdict is blocked until live verification passes.

**Skip:** pure refactors, config-only, test-only, backend-only with no
user-facing surface.

## Plausible-but-Wrong Patterns

LLMs optimize for plausibility, not correctness. Reviewers must hunt for:
- Wrong algorithm complexity (O(n²) where O(log n) is needed)
- Unnecessary abstractions (82K lines vs 1-line solution)
- Stub implementations that pass tests but don't actually work
- "Specification-shaped" code — right module names, wrong behavior
- Missing invariant checks that only matter at scale

## Simplification Pass

After review passes, if diff > 200 LOC net:
- Look for code that can be deleted
- Collapse unnecessary abstractions
- Simplify complex conditionals
- Remove compatibility shims with no real users

## Review Scoring

After the final verdict, append one JSON line to `.groom/review-scores.ndjson`
in the target project root (create `.groom/` if needed):

```json
{"date":"2026-04-06","pr":42,"correctness":8,"depth":7,"simplicity":9,"craft":8,"verdict":"ship","providers":["claude","thinktank","codex","gemini"]}
```

- Scores (1-10) reflect cross-provider consensus, not any single reviewer.
- `pr` is the PR number, or `null` when reviewing a branch without a PR.
- `verdict`: `"ship"`, `"conditional"`, or `"dont-ship"`.
- `providers`: which review tiers contributed.
- This file is committed to git (not gitignored). `/groom` reads it for quality trends.

## Verdict Ref (git-native review proof)

After scoring, record the verdict as a git ref so `/settle` and pre-merge hooks
can enforce review requirements without GitHub PRs.

```bash
source scripts/lib/verdicts.sh
verdict_write "<branch>" '{"branch":"<branch>","base":"<base>","verdict":"<ship|conditional|dont-ship>","reviewers":[...],"scores":{...},"sha":"<HEAD-sha>","date":"<ISO-8601>"}'
```

- Write on every review, not just "ship" — "dont-ship" verdicts block `/settle --land`.
- The `sha` field MUST be `git rev-parse HEAD` at the time of review. If the branch
  gets new commits after review, the verdict is stale and `/settle` will re-trigger review.
- Verdict refs live under `refs/verdicts/<branch>` and sync via `git push/fetch`.
- Also write a copy to `.evidence/<branch>/<date>/verdict.json` for browsability.
- The escape hatch (`SPELLBOOK_NO_REVIEW=1`) is handled at the caller (`scripts/land.sh`, `pre-merge-commit`), never inside `/code-review`.

Skip this step if `scripts/lib/verdicts.sh` does not exist in the target project
(Spellbook-only feature, not expected in downstream repos).

## Gotchas

- **Self-review leniency:** Models overrate their own work. Reviewers must be separate sub-agents, not the builder evaluating itself.
- **Reviewing the whole codebase:** Review the diff, not the repo. `git diff main...HEAD` is the scope.
- **Skipping tiers:** Internal bench alone is same-model groupthink. Thinktank + cross-harness provide genuine model and harness diversity.
- **Misreading a live Thinktank run:** `review.md`, `summary.md`, and
  `agents/*.md` may not exist until late. Watch stderr progress or
  `trace/summary.json`, not just the directory listing. `thinktank review eval`
  is broken in 6.3.0, so consume the final stdout JSON or the finished files.
- **Treating all concerns equally:** Blocking issues (correctness, security) gate shipping. Style preferences don't.
- **Monoculture:** The whole point of three tiers is provider diversity. Don't skip external tiers for speed.
- **Over-prescribing prompts:** You are the marshal. Craft prompts that fit the diff. The references describe lenses, not scripts.
