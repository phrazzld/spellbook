  Inner-loop composer. Takes one backlog item to merge-ready code. Composes
  /shape → /implement → {/code-review + /ci + /refactor + /qa} (clean loop)
  and stops. Does not push, does not merge, does not deploy. Communicates
  with callers via exit code + receipt.json — no stdout parsing.
  Every run also ends with a tight operator-facing brief plus a full
  /reflect session.
  Use when: building a shaped ticket, "deliver this", "make it merge-ready",
  driving one backlog item through review + CI + QA.
  Trigger: /deliver.

# /deliver

Inner-loop composer. One backlog item → merge-ready code. **Delivered ≠
shipped.** The outer loop (`/flywheel`) consumes the receipt and
decides whether to deploy. Humans merge.

## Invariants

- Compose atomic phase skills. Never inline phase logic.
- Fail loud. Never swallow a phase failure into a "best effort" pass.

## Closeout Contract

Every `/deliver` run ends with two operator-facing outputs, in this order:
1. A tight delivery brief.
2. A full `/reflect` session.

This does not replace the machine contract. `receipt.json` remains the source
of truth for callers and automation. The brief and reflection are for the
human operator.

The delivery brief is short and punchy. It is not a file inventory, a raw
changelog, or a generic "green tests" note. Default shape: 1-2 short
paragraphs or 4-6 flat bullets.

The delivery brief must answer:
- What ticket was worked and what changed.
- What value the ticket adds, and why making it merge-ready is useful and
  important now.
- What alternatives to the implemented design existed.
- Why the implemented design is best under the current constraints. If it is
  not clearly best, say so plainly and explain why it was still the right
  delivery choice.
- What value the change creates for developers and operators.
- What value the change creates for users or customers once it ships.
- What was verified, and what residual risk remains before merge or deploy.

`/reflect` remains mandatory. Do not collapse reflection into the delivery
brief. The brief explains the delivered result; `/reflect` captures the
learnings, harness changes, and follow-on mutations.

When `/deliver` is invoked under `/flywheel`, keep the same content shape but
let the outer loop own the final session-level shipping brief.

## Composition

```

## Phase Routing

| Phase | Skill | What it owns | Skip when |
|---|---|---|---|
| shape | `/shape` | context packet, oracle, sequence | packet already has executable oracle |
| implement | `/implement` | TDD red→green→refactor, commits on feature branch | — |
| review | `/code-review` | parallel bench review, synthesized findings | — |
| ci | `/ci` | dagger audit + green pipeline | `/ci` itself decides — do not pre-filter |
| refactor | `/refactor` | diff-aware simplification | trivial diffs (<20 LOC, single file) |
| qa | `/qa` | browser-driven exploratory test, evidence | no user-facing surface (pure library/refactor) |

Each skill has its own contract and receipt. `/deliver` reads those
receipts; it never re-implements the phase.

## Cross-Cutting Invariants

- **No claims.** Dropped per operating principle. Single local workspace.
  Concurrent worktrees coordinate via state-dir isolation (see
  `references/worktree.md`).
- **Never re-deliver stale backlog.** If the target item already carries
  `## What Was Built` or current-branch history contains an explicit closure
  marker like `Closes backlog:<item-id>` / `Ships backlog:<item-id>`, stop
  and route to `/groom tidy`. That is backlog drift, not fresh delivery work.
- **Never push.** Delivery ≠ shipping. `git push` is the outer loop's call.
- **Never merge.** `gh pr merge` is a human decision.
- **Never deploy.** `/deploy` is the outer loop's concern.
- **Never commit to default.** Feature branch only; see `references/branch.md`.
- **Fail loud.** A dirty phase is a dirty phase — do not mask it, do not
  retry past the cap, do not write `status: merge_ready` when anything is
  red.
- **Evidence is out-of-band.** `/deliver` writes zero artifacts itself;
  per-phase skills emit; receipt records pointers only. See
  `references/evidence.md`.

## Contract (exit code + receipt)

`/deliver` communicates exclusively via its exit code and
`<state-dir>/receipt.json`. Callers — human or `/flywheel` outer loop —
do not parse stdout.

| Exit | Meaning | Receipt `status` |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | merge-ready | `merge_ready` |
| 10 | phase handler hard-failed (tool/infra error) | `phase_failed` |
| 20 | clean loop exhausted (3 iterations, still dirty) | `clean_loop_exhausted` |
| 30 | user/SIGINT abort | `aborted` |
| 40 | invalid args / missing dep skill | `phase_failed` |
| 41 | double-invoke on an already-delivered item | `phase_failed` |

Full receipt schema + state lifecycle: `references/receipt.md`.

## Resume & Durability

State is filesystem-backed and resumable.

- **State root:** `<worktree-root>/.spellbook/deliver/<ulid>/` (gitignored).
  Override via `--state-dir <path>` (the outer loop uses this to land state
  under its cycle's evidence tree).
- **Checkpoint:** after each phase, `state.json` rewritten atomically
  (write → fsync → rename).
- **`--resume <ulid>`:** loads `state.json`, skips completed phases,
  re-enters at `current_phase`. Phase handlers must be idempotent.
- **`--abandon <ulid>`:** removes state-dir; leaves branch as-is.
- **Double-invoke:** `/deliver <already-delivered-item>` → exit 41, not
  silent re-run.

Full protocol: `references/durability.md`.

## Gotchas (judgment, not procedure)

- **Retry vs escalate.** Dirty on iteration 1 → retry (normal). Dirty on
  iteration 3 → exit 20, write receipt, hand to human. Do not invent a 4th
  iteration. The cap is load-bearing: loops without one produce slop.
- **What counts as "dirty".** `/code-review` blocking verdict, `/ci`
  non-zero, `/qa` P0/P1. P2 QA findings are documented in the receipt and
  do NOT block. Review "nit" and "consider" are not blocking.
- **Inlining a missing phase.** `/implement` missing → exit 40. Do NOT
  fall back to your own TDD build — inlined fallbacks become permanent.
- **Silent push.** A phase skill that "helpfully" runs `git push` is a bug
  in that phase skill. Surface it; do not suppress it in the composer.
- **Re-shaping mid-delivery.** If `/implement` or `/qa` reveals the shape
  is wrong, stop the clean loop and exit with remaining_work pointing at
  re-shape. Do not spin.
- **Skipping shape.** Building without a context packet yields plausible
  garbage. If the item has no oracle, `/shape` runs first. Always.
- **Review without verdict = dirty.** If `/code-review` runs but no `refs/verdicts/<branch>` points at HEAD afterward, treat the review phase as failed.
- **Merging.** Never. End-state is merge-ready, not merged.
- **Stale active item.** An item can be "open" in `backlog.d/` and still be
  already shipped in git history because a human landed it outside `/flywheel`.
  Refuse to treat that as new work; fix the backlog state first.
