  Configure the active set of Spellbook primitives for the current project.
  Reads .spellbook.yaml manifest, pulls skills and agents from GitHub,
  manages harness-specific setup (Claude Code, Codex, Pi).
  Use when: starting a session, setting up a project, "focus",
  "what skills do I need", "set up skills", "configure primitives",
  "init spellbook", "sync skills", "add skill", "remove skill".

# /focus

Configure the active Spellbook primitives for this project. Nuke-and-rebuild
managed primitives on every run. Leave unmanaged primitives untouched.

## Constants

```
SPELLBOOK_REPO:    phrazzld/spellbook
SPELLBOOK_RAW:     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phrazzld/spellbook/master
EMBEDDINGS_URL:    ${SPELLBOOK_RAW}/embeddings.json
INDEX_URL:         ${SPELLBOOK_RAW}/index.yaml
MANIFEST_FILE:     .spellbook.yaml
MARKER_FILE:       .spellbook
```

## Global Skills (Already Available)

These skills are installed globally by `bootstrap.sh` and are always available.
**Never suggest, fetch, or install these — they're already present:**

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| autopilot | Full delivery pipeline |
| calibrate | Mid-session harness postmortem |
| context-engineering | Context lifecycle for AI agents |
| debug | Investigate, audit, triage, fix |
| focus | This skill — primitive management |
| groom | Backlog grooming and doctrine |
| harness-engineering | Design agent-friendly environments |
| moonshot | Highest-leverage innovation |
| pr | Tidy, commit, open world-class PR |
| reflect | Session retrospective, codification |
| research | Multi-source retrieval and validation |
| settle | Unblock PR: fix, polish, simplify |
| skill | Create skills from procedural knowledge |

**Global agents:** beck, carmack, grug, ousterhout

Focus manages **domain skills** — the project-specific knowledge primitives
that complement the always-available process layer.

## Routing

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/focus` | Sync from manifest. If no manifest, run init. |
| `/focus init` | Analyze project from first principles, generate `.spellbook.yaml` |
| `/focus sync` | Force re-pull all managed primitives |
| `/focus add <name>` | Add skill, agent, or collection to manifest and sync |
| `/focus remove <name>` | Remove from manifest and delete locally |
| `/focus search <query>` | Search the Spellbook index |
| `/focus list` | Show manifest contents and install status |
| `/focus improve` | Synthesize observations into spellbook improvements |

If invoked with a task description (e.g., `/focus fix payment webhooks`),
run the smart selection flow: search index for task-relevant primitives,
suggest manifest changes, then sync.

## Invariant: Always Project-Local

Focus installs ONLY into the current project directory. Never into global
harness directories (~/.claude/, ~/.codex/, etc.). The only global primitives
are the bootstrap set (above).

If the user wants primitives available everywhere, they navigate to their
global config directory and run focus there. Focus does not decide scope —
the working directory decides scope.

## Core Flow

### 1. Detect Harness

Determine which agent harness is running:

```bash
if [ -n "${CLAUDE_CODE:-}" ] || [ -d ".claude" ]; then HARNESS="claude-code"
elif [ -n "${CODEX:-}" ] || [ -d ".codex" ]; then HARNESS="codex"
elif [ -d ".agents" ]; then HARNESS="agents"
fi
```

Load harness-specific reference from `references/harnesses/${HARNESS}.md`.

**Harness directory mapping (all paths relative to project root):**

| Harness | Skills Dir | Agents Dir |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `.claude/agents/` |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/` | `.codex/agents/` |
| Generic | `.agents/skills/` | `.agents/agents/` |

### 2. Read or Create Manifest

If `.spellbook.yaml` exists at project root, read it.

If not, run the init flow (see `references/init.md`).

### 3. Resolve Skill References

Each skill is either unqualified or fully qualified:

```
debug                                    → source: phrazzld/spellbook
anthropics/skills@frontend-design        → source: anthropics/skills
vercel-labs/agent-skills@vercel-react-best-practices → source: vercel-labs/agent-skills
```

Unqualified names resolve to `phrazzld/spellbook`. External skills use
`owner/repo@skill-name` format to avoid name collisions.

**Critical filter:** If a resolved skill name matches any global skill
(see table above), skip it silently. Global skills are never project-installed.

### 4. Nuke Managed Primitives

Scan the local harness skills and agents directories. Find ALL directories
containing a `.spellbook` marker file. Delete them entirely.

```bash
find "${SKILLS_DIR}" -name ".spellbook" -maxdepth 2 | while read marker; do
  rm -rf "$(dirname "$marker")"
done
find "${AGENTS_DIR}" -name ".spellbook" -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null | while read marker; do
  rm -rf "$(dirname "$marker")"
done
```

**Critical**: Only directories with a `.spellbook` marker are touched.
Everything else is invisible to focus and will not be modified or deleted.

### 5. Install Primitives

For each resolved skill, download from its source. See `references/sync.md`.

### 5b. Install Agents

Agents are markdown files (not directories). Install to the agents dir.
For Claude Code, agent files are used as-is (markdown + YAML frontmatter).
For Codex, translate to TOML format during install (see harness references).

### 6. Harness-Specific Setup

After installing primitives, run harness-specific configuration.
See `references/harnesses/claude-code.md` and `references/harnesses/codex.md`.

### 7. Report

```markdown
## Focus Complete

**Harness**: Claude Code
**Manifest**: .spellbook.yaml (5 domain skills, 2 agents)
**Global layer**: 13 skills + 4 agents (via bootstrap, not shown)

### Installed (domain)
| Type | Name | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| skill | stripe | installed |
| skill | next-patterns | installed |
| agent | stripe-auditor | installed |

### Unchanged (not managed by Spellbook)
- my-custom-deploy-skill/

### Errors
(none)
```

## Managed vs Unmanaged

**Spellbook-managed**: Any directory containing a `.spellbook` marker file.
Focus will delete and recreate these on every sync.

**Unmanaged**: Any directory WITHOUT a `.spellbook` marker file.
Focus will never read, modify, or delete these.

## .spellbook.yaml Manifest Format

```yaml
# .spellbook.yaml — checked into git, harness-agnostic
# Only domain/workflow skills go here. Process skills are global.
skills:
  - stripe
  - next-patterns
  - anthropics/skills@frontend-design
agents:
  - stripe-auditor
```

## Smart Selection

When invoked with a task description:

1. Run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search.py "<task description>" --top 15 --json`
2. **Filter out global skills** — never suggest what's already available
3. Check which remaining primitives are already in the manifest
4. Suggest additions (with reasoning and similarity scores)
5. Ask user to confirm before modifying manifest
6. Sync

## Anti-Patterns

- **Never install to global directories.** ~/.claude/, ~/.codex/ are off-limits.
- **Never suggest global skills.** They're already available. Don't waste the
  user's time recommending what they already have.
- Never touch directories without `.spellbook` markers
- Never install primitives not declared in the manifest
- Never skip the nuke step — stale state causes subtle bugs
- Never hardcode paths — always derive from harness detection
- **Never bulk-add a collection without filtering.** Every expanded skill must
  pass the "useful in THIS repo" test.
- **Never skip agent syncing.** Agents are first-class primitives.
