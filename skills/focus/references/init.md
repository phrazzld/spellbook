# Focus Init

Generate a `.spellbook.yaml` manifest for a project that doesn't have one.

## Philosophy

Don't start by searching the catalog. Start by understanding the project
deeply, then reason from first principles about what domain knowledge
would make an agent most effective here. Search comes after thinking.

## Process

### Phase 1: Deep Project Analysis

Read everything available to understand what this project IS:

| Signal | Where |
|--------|-------|
| Project purpose, tech stack | `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| Dependencies | `package.json`, `go.mod`, `mix.exs`, `Gemfile`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml` |
| Directory structure | `ls` top-level dirs |
| Recent activity | `git log --oneline -20` |
| External services | `.env.example`, config files, API references |
| Existing skills | `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/` |

Synthesize a 1-2 paragraph description of the project covering:
what it does, what tech it uses, what domains it touches, what
external services it integrates with.

### Phase 2: First-Principles Skill Design

Using context-engineering and harness-engineering thinking, reason about
what domain knowledge would make an agent most effective in this project.
Do NOT look at the catalog yet. Think from the project's needs.

**Answer these questions:**

1. **What domains does this project touch?** (payments, auth, data pipeline,
   frontend framework, mobile, infrastructure, etc.)
2. **What external services does it integrate with?** (Stripe, AWS, Vercel,
   Sentry, PostHog, database provider, etc.)
3. **What recurring agent tasks would benefit from domain expertise?**
   (e.g., "writing Stripe webhook handlers requires knowing idempotency
   patterns, event types, and signature verification")
4. **What are the most common failure modes an agent would hit?**
   (e.g., "Next.js App Router caching gotchas", "Convex transaction limits")
5. **What knowledge is NOT already covered by the global process skills?**
   Remember: autopilot, calibrate, context-engineering, debug, focus, groom,
   harness-engineering, moonshot, pr, reflect, research, settle, skill
   are already available. Only domain-specific knowledge is missing.

Produce a **wishlist**: a list of ideal domain skill descriptions, independent
of whether they exist in any catalog.

### Phase 3: Search and Match

Now search the Spellbook index for skills matching the wishlist:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search.py --project-dir . --top 20 --json
```

Also run targeted searches for each wishlist item:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search.py "stripe webhook patterns" --top 5 --json
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search.py "Next.js App Router" --top 5 --json
```

**Critical filter:** Exclude all global skills from results. These are
already available and must never appear in the manifest:
autopilot, calibrate, context-engineering, debug, focus, groom,
harness-engineering, moonshot, pr, reflect, research, settle, skill.

For each search result, map it against the wishlist:
- Does this skill address a concrete wishlist item?
- Is the match precise or vague?

### Phase 4: Diff — Identify the Gaps

Compare the wishlist against search results:

| Wishlist Item | Match Found? | Skill Name | Quality |
|--------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Stripe webhook patterns | Yes | stripe | Strong |
| Next.js caching gotchas | Yes | next-patterns | Strong |
| Custom auth middleware | No | — | — |
| Convex transaction patterns | No | — | — |

**For items with strong matches:** Add to manifest.

**For items with no match:** These are skill gaps — opportunities to create
new skills that would benefit this project and others.

### Phase 5: Generate Manifest

```yaml
# .spellbook.yaml
# Domain skills for [project description]
# Global skills (13) + agents (4) are available via bootstrap.
skills:
  - stripe
  - next-patterns
  - anthropics/skills@frontend-design
agents:
  - stripe-auditor
```

### Phase 6: Present for Confirmation

Show the user:

1. **Project analysis** (what was detected)
2. **Wishlist** (what domain knowledge would be ideal)
3. **Matched skills** with reasoning
4. **Skill gaps** — wishlist items with no match

For each gap, offer:
> "No existing skill covers [X]. Want me to draft a new skill for this
> and open a PR to spellbook?"

Only write manifest after explicit confirmation.

### Phase 7: Create Skills for Gaps (Optional)

If the user approves creating skills for unmatched wishlist items:

1. Use `/skill` to draft the new skill
2. Create a branch in a spellbook worktree
3. Open a PR with the new skill
4. Add the skill name to the manifest (it'll be available after merge + re-index)

This is how spellbook grows organically from real project needs.

### Phase 8: Run Sync

After writing the manifest, immediately run the sync flow to install
the declared domain primitives.

## External Sources

Skills from external sources use fully qualified names (FQN):

```yaml
skills:
  - stripe                                       # phrazzld/spellbook (default)
  - anthropics/skills@frontend-design            # external source
  - vercel-labs/agent-skills@vercel-react-best-practices
  - garrytan/gstack@qa                           # gstack source
```

Unqualified names resolve to `phrazzld/spellbook`. Any other source
must use `owner/repo@skill-name` format.
