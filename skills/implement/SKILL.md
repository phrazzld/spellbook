  Atomic TDD build skill. Takes a context packet (shaped ticket) and
  produces code + tests on a feature branch. Red → Green → Refactor.
  Does not shape, review, QA, or ship — single concern: spec to green tests.
  Use when: "implement this spec", "build this", "TDD this", "code this up",
  "write the code for this ticket", after /shape has produced a context packet.
  Trigger: /implement, /build (alias).

# /implement

Spec in, green tests out. One packet, one feature branch, one concern.

## Invariants

- Trust the context packet. Do not reshape. Do not re-plan.
- If the packet is incomplete, **fail loudly** — do not invent the spec.

## Contract

**Input.** A context packet: goal, non-goals, constraints, repo anchors,
oracle (executable preferred), implementation sequence. Resolution order:

1. Explicit path argument (`/implement backlog.d/033-foo.md`)
2. Backlog item ID (`/implement 033`) → resolves via `backlog.d/<id>-*.md`
3. Last `/shape` output in the current session
4. **No packet found → stop.** Do not guess the spec from a title.

Required packet fields (hard gate — missing any = stop):
- `goal` (one sentence, testable)
- `oracle` (how we know it's done, ideally executable commands)
- `implementation sequence` (ordered steps, or explicit "single chunk")

See `references/context-packet.md` for the full shape.

**Output.**
- Code + tests on a feature branch (`<type>/<slug>` from current branch)
- All tests green (new + existing)
- Working tree clean (no debug prints, no scratch files)
- Commits in repo convention — one logical unit per commit
- Final message: branch ref + oracle checklist status

**Stops at:** green tests + clean tree. Does not run `/code-review`,
`/qa`, `/ci`, or open a PR.

## Workflow

### 1. Load and validate packet

Resolve the packet (order above). Parse required fields. If any are missing
or vague ("add feature X" with no oracle), stop with:

> Packet incomplete: missing <field>. Run /shape first.

Do not try to fill in the gaps. Shape is a different skill's judgment.

### 2. Create the feature branch

`git checkout -b <type>/<slug>` from the current branch. Builders never
commit to master/main. If you forget, create the branch after and
cherry-pick before handing off.

### 3. Dispatch the builder

Spawn a **builder** sub-agent (general-purpose) with:
- The full context packet
- The executable oracle
- The TDD mandate (see below)
- File ownership (if the packet decomposes into disjoint chunks, spawn
  multiple builders in parallel — one per chunk, each with subset of oracle)

**Builder prompt must include:**
> You MUST write a failing test before production code. RED → GREEN →
> REFACTOR → COMMIT. Exceptions: config files, generated code, UI layout.
> Document any skipped-TDD step inline in the commit message.

See `references/tdd-loop.md` for the full cycle and skip rules.

### 4. Verify exit conditions

Before exiting, confirm:
- [ ] Every oracle command exits 0 (run them, don't trust the builder)
- [ ] `git status` clean (no untracked debug files)
- [ ] No `TODO`/`FIXME`/`console.log` added that isn't in the spec
- [ ] Commits are logically atomic (one concern per commit)

If any check fails, dispatch a builder sub-agent to fix. Max 2 fix loops,
then escalate.

### 5. Hand off

Output: feature branch name, commit list, oracle checklist (which commands
pass), residual risks. Do not run review, do not merge, do not push unless
the packet explicitly says so.

## Scoping Judgment (what the model must decide)

- **Test granularity.** One behavior per test. If you can't name the
  behavior in one short sentence, the test is too big.
- **When to skip TDD.** Config, generated code, UI layout, pure
  exploration. Document the skip in the commit. Everything else: test first.
- **When to escalate.** Builder loops on the same test failure 3+ times,
  the oracle contradicts the constraints, or the spec requires behavior
  that violates an invariant. Stop and report, don't power through.
- **Parallelism.** Only parallelize when file ownership is disjoint and
  oracle criteria partition cleanly. Shared files → serial builders.
- **Refactor depth.** The refactor step in TDD is local — improve the
  code you just wrote. Broader refactors are `/refactor`'s job, not yours.

## What /implement does NOT do

- Pick tickets (caller's job, or `/deliver` / `/flywheel`)
- Shape or re-shape specs (→ `/shape`)
- Code review (→ `/code-review`)
- QA against the running app (→ `/qa`)
- CI gates / lint (→ `/ci`)
- Simplification passes beyond TDD refactor (→ `/refactor`)
- Ship, merge, deploy (→ human, or `/settle`)

## Stopping Conditions

Stop with a loud report if:
- Packet is incomplete or ambiguous
- Oracle is unverifiable (prose-only checkboxes with no executable form —
  write one, or stop)
- Builder fails the same test 3+ times after targeted fix attempts
- Spec contradicts itself or violates a stated invariant
- Tests hit an external dependency that isn't available

**Not** stopping conditions: spec is hard, unfamiliar codebase, initial
tests red. Those are the job.

## Gotchas

- **Reshaping inside /implement.** If the spec is wrong, stop. Don't
  silently rewrite the oracle to match what you built.
- **Declaring victory with partial oracle.** "Most tests pass" is not
  green. Every oracle command exits 0, or you're not done.
- **Silent catch-and-return.** New code that swallows exceptions and
  returns fallbacks is hiding bugs. Fail loud. Test the failure mode.
- **Testing implementation, not behavior.** Tests that assert the
  structure of the code break on every refactor. Test what the code
  does from the outside.
- **Committing debug noise.** `console.log`, `print("here")`, commented-out
  code. The tree must be clean before exit.
- **Skipping TDD without documenting.** Config and generated code are
  fine exceptions; silently skipping because "it was simpler" is not.
- **Parallelizing coupled builders.** Two builders editing files that
  import each other = merge pain and lost work. Partition by file
  ownership before parallel dispatch.
- **Branch drift.** Forgetting to create the feature branch and
  committing to the current branch. Always `git checkout -b` first.
- **Scope creep from builders.** Builder adds "while I'm here"
  improvements. The spec is the constraint — raise a blocker, don't
  silently expand the diff.
- **Trusting self-reported success.** Builders say "all tests pass."
  Verify by running the oracle yourself. Agents lie (accidentally).
