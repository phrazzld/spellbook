name: reflect
description: |
  Session retrospective, operator coaching, harness postmortem, codification,
  and outer-loop cycle critique. Distills learnings into hooks/rules/skills,
  mutates the backlog from evidence, and emits harness-tuning suggestions to
  a branch. Learning engine of the outer loop.
  Use when: "done", "wrap up", "what did we learn", "retro", "reflect",
  "calibrate", "how could I have asked better", "prompt better",
  "teach me from this session", "what should I learn from this",
  "reflect on cycle", "cycle postmortem", post-/flywheel critique.
  Trigger: /reflect, /retro, /calibrate, /reflect cycle <cycle-ulid>.

# /reflect

Structured reflection that improves both the harness and the operator.

Every finding becomes one of three things:
- a codified artifact
- a concrete coaching note
- an explicit justification for not codifying

## Routing

| Mode | Intent | Reference |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **distill** (default) | End-of-session retrospective -> codified artifacts + operator coaching | `references/distill.md` |
| **calibrate** | Mid-session harness postmortem — fix the harness before the code | `references/calibrate.md` |
| **coach** | Deep dive on prompt quality, technical specificity, and concept building | `references/coach.md` |
| **tune-repo** | Refresh context artifacts, detect drift, update repo guidance | `references/tune-repo.md` |
| **append** | Append issue-scoped retro notes for `/groom` to consume later | `references/retro-format.md` |
| **cycle** | Bounded end-of-ship retrospective invoked by `/ship` — emit backlog mutations, harness-tuning proposals, and a cycle summary for the caller to apply | `references/cycle.md` |

If the first argument matches a mode name, route to that reference.
If no mode is provided, run `distill`.

Interpret natural-language requests as:
- "how could I have asked better", "teach me from this", "help me prompt better"
  -> `coach`
- "why did you do that", "you made the wrong call", "fix your instructions"
  -> `calibrate`
- "tune this repo", "refresh AGENTS", "context drift"
  -> `tune-repo`
- "reflect on cycle <cycle-id>", "postmortem this cycle", invocation from
  `/ship` (or transitively from `/flywheel`, which composes `/ship`)
  -> `cycle`

## Responsibility Split

Reflection must separate three classes of failure:

1. **Harness failure** — the instructions, skills, tools, or codebase should
   have prevented the problem
2. **Shared ambiguity** — both sides left important constraints implicit
3. **Operator-spec gap** — the decisive information lived only in the user's
   head, so a tighter prompt would have reduced search space

Do not dump harness failures onto the user. If the repo, docs, or available
context already contained the answer, that is not a prompt-quality critique.

## Default Deliverables

Even in `distill`, inspect both lanes:
- **System lane** — instructions, skills, hooks, tests, CI, AGENTS.md, docs
- **Operator lane** — prompt rewrites, vocabulary, stack concepts, next-session moves

System codification is mandatory.
Operator coaching is mandatory to assess, but only mandatory to emit when there
is concrete, high-leverage feedback. Otherwise say so explicitly instead of
manufacturing generic advice.

Use `coach` when the user wants the operator lane expanded into a deeper lesson.

## Codification Hierarchy

When encoding knowledge, always target the highest-leverage mechanism:

```
Type system > Lint rule > Hook > Test > CI > Skill/reference > AGENTS.md > Memory
```

## Cycle Mode Authority (outer-loop only)

`cycle` is a **bounded invocation**: `/ship` calls it at the end of the
final-mile pipeline to capture learnings from the just-shipped ticket.
`/flywheel` triggers it transitively by composing `/ship`. When invoked as
`cycle`, reflect gains two privileges the other modes lack:

1. **Backlog mutation proposals** — may propose create, edit, consolidate,
   reprioritize, or delete on items in `backlog.d/` (never
   `backlog.d/_done/`). Every proposal must cite an evidence ref from the
   cycle (commit, diff hunk, receipt path, log line).
2. **Harness-tuning proposals** — may propose skill/agent/hook/AGENTS.md/
   CLAUDE.md edits. Reflect **emits**; it does not apply. The caller
   routes these to a harness branch for human review.

All other modes are read-only against `backlog.d/` and the harness. If
`cycle` cannot cite evidence for a mutation, downgrade it to a finding and
let a human decide.

### Invocation Contract

Triggered as `/reflect cycle` (aliases: `/reflect --cycle <cycle-id>`).
The caller — normally `/ship` — passes this input packet:

- `branch`: name of the just-shipped feature branch (pre-merge).
- `merged_sha`: squash commit SHA now on master/main.
- `closed_backlog_ids`: list of IDs closed in this cycle (the closing set
  from `/ship`'s trailer scan).
- `referenced_backlog_ids` (optional): `Refs-backlog` IDs noted but not
  closed.

A `cycle-id` identifies the retro artifact; derive it from `merged_sha`
short form when the caller does not supply one.

### Output Contract

Three categories. The two structured categories must be cleanly separable
so the caller can apply them under different policies.

1. **Backlog mutations** (structured, machine-consumable). For each:
   - action: `create` | `edit` | `reprioritize` | `delete`
   - path: concrete `backlog.d/<id>-*.md` target
   - body: full file content for `create`, unified diff for `edit`, new
     priority for `reprioritize`, justification for `delete`
   - evidence: cycle ref justifying the mutation
   These are **proposals**. The caller (`/ship`) applies them to master
   via a follow-up commit and owns commit hygiene. Reflect does not stage,
   commit, or push these files itself.

2. **Harness-tuning proposals** (structured, machine-consumable). For each:
   - path: concrete file under `skills/`, `agents/`, `harnesses/`,
     `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a hook script
   - body: unified diff or full new-file content
   - evidence: cycle ref and codification-hierarchy justification
   Reflect **must not** write these to master. The caller routes them to
   a harness branch (`/ship` uses `harness/reflect-outputs`). A `cycle`
   run that mutates harness files on the current branch is a bug.

3. **Cycle summary** (human-readable narrative). What shipped, what was
   learned, what went well, what went poorly. Also written to the
   standard retro location (`.groom/retro/<primary-id>.md` or the
   `.spellbook/reflect/<cycle-id>/` receipts dir, matching whatever
   convention the invoking repo already uses).

### Invariants

- **Harness mutations never land on master directly.** Reflect emits;
  the caller routes to a harness branch. This is a hard cross-skill
  invariant also asserted in `ship/SKILL.md`.
- **Backlog mutations are proposals, not auto-applied.** Reflect does
  not `git add` / `git commit` on behalf of the caller.
- **Session-retrospective mode still works standalone.** `distill`,
  `calibrate`, `coach`, `tune-repo`, and `append` remain usable without
  cycle context — `cycle` is additive, not a replacement.

See `references/cycle.md` for judgment rules (consolidate vs split,
when to escalate to a harness branch, evidence standards).

## Gotchas

- **Blaming the user for missing repo context**: If the agent could have found
  it, it is a harness or retrieval failure.
- **Giving generic prompt advice**: "Be more specific" is not feedback. Name
  the missing constraint, example, acceptance test, or boundary.
- **Skipping the operator lane**: A retro that only mutates harness artifacts
  leaves user leverage on the table.
- **Turning coaching into scolding**: Start with what the prompt achieved, then
  show the stronger version and why it improves the search space.
- **Teaching concepts without anchoring them to the session**: Vocabulary only
  sticks when tied to a concrete decision, bug, or design tradeoff.
