  Tailor this repository's harness. Explore the repo, read prior
  session history, browse the spellbook catalog, and install a
  per-repo set of skills into a shared repo-local skill layer, with
  harness-specific entrypoints bridged back to that shared copy.
  Workflow skills get rewritten with this repo's commands and
  conventions embedded throughout — not a generic body with a
  repo-notes appendix. Use when: "tailor this repo", "configure the
  agent for this codebase", "set up a harness", "what skills apply
  here". Trigger: /tailor.

# /tailor

You're a tailor, not a wardrobe curator. Spellbook is a reference
library — fabric bolts, pattern drafts, technique books. For this
repo you *cut new garments* from that material, sized to fit in
every seam. Sewing an extra inch onto an off-the-rack jacket is not
tailoring; it's decoration.

## Shape of the work

1. **Explore.** Read enough of this repo to know what it is —
   language, frameworks, test/CI/deploy commands, size, domain.
   `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml`, README, top-level
   structure.

   **Also inventory any existing harness.** Resolve the repo's
   **shared skill root** first: prefer an existing `.agent/skills/`,
   then an existing `.agents/skills/`. If neither exists yet, note
   that you will create one during install. Then inspect that shared
   root plus any existing harness bridges such as `.claude/skills/`,
   `.claude/agents/`, `.codex/skills/`, or `.pi/skills/`. If any
   have content, classify each entry:
   - **Tailor-owned** — has a `.spellbook` marker file with
     `source: <name>`, `installed: <timestamp>`, and (newer runs)
     `installed-by: tailor`. Safe to replace or remove.
   - **Scaffolded** — marker says `installed-by: <skill>-scaffold`
     (e.g. `qa-scaffold`, `demo-scaffold`) or the content is a
     scaffold output the repo explicitly authored. Preserve.
   - **Human-authored / unknown** — no marker, or marker from an
     era before current /tailor (no `installed-by` field). Preserve
     by default; flag for user confirmation before overwriting.

   Read the repo-level `.spellbook/repo-brief.md` if present —
   it's the prior run's brief, useful for diffing what changed.

2. **Prior art.** If your harness keeps session history for this repo
   (Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/<path-hash>/`, Codex: analogous
   state path), read the session JSONL and memory files. What
   commands does the user actually run here? Where have they
   corrected you? Highest-signal input available.

3. **Browse.** Read the spellbook catalog — resolve via `readlink -f`
   on this SKILL.md, walk up to find `$SPELLBOOK/skills/` and
   `$SPELLBOOK/agents/`. Each primitive's frontmatter describes when
   to use it. That's your map.

4. **Synthesize a repo brief.** Write a short prose document
   (1-2 pages) that every downstream subagent will read. It is
   the shared spine that keeps rewrites coherent — without it,
   `/ci` calls the enforcing layer one thing and `/deliver` calls
   it another. Required anchors:

   - **Vision & purpose** — what this repo is building, for whom.
   - **Stack & boundaries** — layers and what each owns.
   - **Load-bearing gate** — *the* single declaration of what must
     pass to ship (e.g. "`pnpm ci:prepush` IS the gate; the Dagger
     lanes are its components"). Every gate-adjacent skill cites
     this verbatim.
   - **Invariants** — repo-wide rules (don't touch X, base branch
     is Y, commits go through Z).
   - **Known debts** — active issues, hot files, recurring failure
     modes, incident IDs. Pull from backlog, session history, and
     recent git log.
   - **Terminology** — what this repo calls its things.
   - **Session signal** — 3-5 recurring user corrections from
     session JSONL + 3-5 validated patterns the user has ratified.

   Short, dense, concrete. This is the single source of truth for
   "what is this repo" that every rewriter anchors to.

   **Persist the brief to `.spellbook/repo-brief.md`** at the repo
   root. Future runs read it to diff what's changed. Overwrite any
   existing version.

5. **Pick.** Dispatch planner + critic subagents with the repo
   brief attached. Planner proposes a set following the picking
   defaults below; critic applies `references/focus-postmortem.md`.

   **Planner must also propose ≥1 candidate domain invention per
   round**, with the concrete repo characteristic that would justify
   it (e.g., "`/convex-migrate` — this repo has live-traffic Convex
   schema evolution with `v.optional` upgrade paths in
   `convex/schema.ts`"). The critic evaluates via criterion 4. Landing
   on "none justified" is a valid outcome — the point is to force the
   thinking, not the output. Repos with load-bearing domain needs
   shouldn't slip through because the picker never considered them.

   One round. Stop on critic-clear.

6. **Install.** First reconcile, then write. **The shared skill root
   is canonical; `.claude/skills/` is a bridge layer** — see
   cross-harness install invariant below.

   **Reconcile.** For each tailor-owned item inventoried in step 1
   (has `.spellbook` marker with `installed-by: tailor`):
   - Still in the new pick → replace with fresh rewrite.
   - Not in the new pick → remove the skill/agent directory. This
     is how `/tailor` self-heals canary-class fossils where the
     prior pick no longer matches the repo's current needs.

   For items without a `.spellbook` marker (unknown origin): do not
   touch without user confirmation. If a skill you're about to
   install collides with an unmarked existing skill of the same
   name, surface the conflict against the shared root: "existing
   `<shared-skill-root>/qa/` has no tailor marker — is it
   scaffolded, human-authored, or prior-era /tailor output?
   [preserve / replace / diff]".

   **Install shared, bridge per-harness.** Write every spellbook-
   distributed skill to the shared skill root
   (`.agent/skills/<name>/` or `.agents/skills/<name>/`, whichever
   this repo uses). Then create or refresh per-harness skill bridges
   back to that shared copy:

   - `.claude/skills/<name>` should be a symlink to the shared skill.
   - If the repo already has `.codex/skills/` or `.pi/skills/`
     bridges, keep them pointed at the same shared skill root.
   - Do not duplicate spellbook-distributed skill trees across
     multiple harness-specific directories.

   Agents are different: install them into the repo's existing agent
   directory (today that is usually `.claude/agents/`) unless the
   repo already documents a shared-agent convention. Do not invent a
   second agent layout just because the skills are shared.

   **Write `.spellbook` markers.** Every shared skill directory and
   every installed agent directory or file updated by this run gets a
   marker file at `<skill-or-agent>/.spellbook` with:

   ```yaml
   source: <primitive-name>
   installed: <ISO-8601 timestamp>
   installed-by: tailor
   tailor-version: <git commit SHA of spellbook/skills/tailor>
   category: universal | workflow | domain-invented
   ```

   Markers are how re-runs tell your output apart from human-
   authored content.

   **Shared scripts.** Tailored skills source shared shell helpers
   at a stable path so they read the same way in every downstream
   repo. Install the following from `$SPELLBOOK/scripts/lib/` to
   `<repo-root>/scripts/lib/` (create the directory if missing):

   - `scripts/lib/backlog.sh` — trailer parsing (`Closes-backlog`,
     `Ships-backlog`, `Refs-backlog`) and `backlog_archive` for
     `git mv`-ing `backlog.d/<id>-*.md` into `backlog.d/_done/`.
     Required by `/ship`, `/groom tidy`, and any skill that
     reconciles master against `backlog.d/`.
   - `scripts/lib/verdicts.sh` — verdict-ref helpers
     (`verdict_check_landable`, etc.). Required by `/ship` and
     `/settle` in git-native mode.

   Copy the files verbatim; do not rewrite. Tailored skills source
   them via the same relative path in every repo, so divergence
   here breaks sourcing in every downstream consumer at once. If
   the repo already has a `scripts/lib/` directory with unrelated
   files, merge additively — never overwrite an unmarked script.
   Emit `.spellbook` markers alongside if the repo-local
   convention uses them for scripts; otherwise rely on content
   parity against spellbook as the drift signal.

   Three categories, different install rules:

   - **Universal skills** — `groom`, `office-hours`, `ceo-review`,
     `reflect`, and similar that carry no repo-specific judgment.
     Copy their directories verbatim. Tailoring them would be
     artificial.
   - **Workflow skills** — `deliver`, `shape`, `implement`,
     `code-review`, `ci`, `refactor`, `qa`, `flywheel`, `deploy`,
     `monitor`, `diagnose`, `settle`, `ship`, `yeet`, `research`.
     **Rewrite each SKILL.md with this repo's commands, gates,
     conventions, and file paths embedded throughout.** Use the
     spellbook version as structural reference; fill every example,
     every command, every gotcha with repo-specific content. Preserve
     `references/` and `scripts/` from the source — they travel with
     the skill.

     **Dispatch one rewriter subagent per workflow skill, in
     parallel.** Monolithic rewriting of 10+ skills in one context
     causes attention decay — the model pattern-matches "just copy
     this one too" and ships byte-identical output. Each rewriter
     receives: (a) the repo brief from step 4 (shared spine —
     cite these anchors, don't invent parallel vocabulary),
     (b) the spellbook source, (c) a reading assignment (see
     table below), (d) the mandate above.

     **Every workflow skill gets a reading assignment.** Skills
     with clear command anchors get rewritten easily; abstract-
     process skills (shape, refactor, code-review, flywheel,
     groom, implement, diagnose) are the ones that silently pass
     through because the source looks "already generic enough."
     They aren't — they're the skills where rewriters have to
     encode *this repo's judgment* as content, since there's no
     command to swap in. Assignments:

     | Skill | Read |
     |---|---|
     | ci | `.github/workflows/`, `dagger/`, `Dockerfile*`, CI status history |
     | deliver | `backlog.d/`, recent merged PRs, CONTRIBUTING.md |
     | deploy | `vercel.json`, `fly.*.toml`, `Dockerfile*`, deploy workflows |
     | settle | merge history, branch-protection rules, release tooling |
     | ship | squash-merge history (`git log --merges master`), drift contract (e.g. `docs/context/DRIFT-WATCHLIST.md`), PR templates, branch-naming conventions, `backlog.d/` + `backlog.d/_done/` layout |
     | yeet | commit history, `commitlint.config.*`, semver tooling |
     | qa | test configs, critical-path routes, Playwright/E2E specs |
     | demo | evidence scripts, demo capture tools |
     | monitor | signal surfaces (Sentry/Canary/health), alerts |
     | **shape** | `backlog.d/*.md`, recent shape docs, planning conventions, design-review lineage |
     | **refactor** | git churn (hot files), debt map, ARCHITECTURE.md, recent refactor PRs, named hotspots from repo brief |
     | **code-review** | AGENTS.md red flags, recent review threads, repo's philosophy bench, known anti-patterns |
     | **flywheel** | milestone tracker, issue IDs from repo brief, recent cycle reflections, deploy observables |
     | **groom** | `backlog.d/` (or equivalent file-driven tracker), GitHub issues if in use, grooming cadence, prioritization scheme |
     | **implement** | test runner command, mocking boundaries, test config, recent TDD cycles, branch-naming convention (`<type>/<id>-<slug>`) |
     | **diagnose** | signal surfaces, `.evidence/`, postmortems, observability tooling |
     | **research** | prior research artifacts (`.claude/research/`, `docs/research/`, `.groom/`), stack manifest (`package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml`) for domain cues, open research threads in `backlog.d/`, repo-specific source/doc lists |

     **Loop-core skills must not ship shallow.** The seven bolded
     rows above (shape, refactor, code-review, flywheel, groom,
     implement, diagnose) are the development loop's connective
     tissue — they encode *how this team builds here*. Their source
     text looks abstract because its job is generic wisdom. *Your*
     rewrite's job is to name what each skill MEANS in this
     codebase: the actual hotspots, the actual red flags, the
     actual backlog conventions, the actual milestone structure,
     the actual test command, the actual signal surfaces. "Generic
     refactoring discipline" is the source's contribution; your
     contribution is "in this repo, refactor first targets
     `getRevealPhaseState` (N+1, #146) and theme-token leakage."
     If your rewrite could describe any Next.js+Convex repo, any
     Elixir/Phoenix repo, any Rust service — it's shallow. Redo.

     **Backlog-automation load-bearing mandates.** The ship/groom/
     settle/flywheel/implement rewriters MUST preserve the
     trailer-based closure contract — it is not stylistic, it is
     what lets `/groom` sweep master and detect stale active
     tickets. Rewriters that "simplify" these away break the loop.

     - **`/ship` rewriter** — must preserve:
       - Branch-name → primary-ID parsing:
         `^(feat|fix|chore|refactor|docs|test|perf)/(\d+)-`.
         The regex is the contract; do not rename prefixes or
         swap `\d+` for a repo-specific scheme without replacing
         the matching convention in `/implement` at the same time.
       - Trailer keys `Closes-backlog:`, `Ships-backlog:` (closing)
         and `Refs-backlog:` (reference-only). Bare numeric IDs.
         Trailers injected via `git interpret-trailers`, never
         hand-formatted.
       - The `backlog_archive` step that `git mv`s
         `backlog.d/<id>-*.md` into `backlog.d/_done/` on the
         feature branch before squash.
       - The explicit-body squash that carries trailers into the
         merge commit on master. GitHub repos: `gh pr merge
         --squash --body "<trailers>"`. Bare-git repos: `git merge
         --squash <branch> && git commit -F <msg>` with the
         trailer block embedded.
       - `/reflect` invocation with bounded scope (just-shipped
         branch name, merged SHA, closing IDs, reference IDs).
       - Harness-branch routing for reflect's harness outputs:
         proposals land on `harness/reflect-outputs`, never on
         master. This is a hard invariant from `reflect/SKILL.md`.
       - Embed the downstream repo's specific **doc-sync
         convention** verbatim. If the repo has a drift contract
         (e.g. olympus: `docs/context/DRIFT-WATCHLIST.md`), cite
         the file path and describe how `/ship` cross-references it
         against `git diff master..HEAD --name-only`. If no drift
         contract exists, state that explicitly and skip the doc
         sync step — do not invent one.
       - Embed the downstream repo's **merge strategy** verbatim:
         GitHub repos use `gh pr merge --squash`; bare-git repos
         use `git merge --squash` + `git commit -F`. Detection
         logic (remote URL + `gh` on PATH + `gh pr view` exit
         code) stays.
     - **`/groom` rewriter** — must preserve:
       - The always-on `tidy` step that sweeps master for
         `Closes-backlog:` / `Ships-backlog:` trailers using
         `scripts/lib/backlog.sh` (installed via the Shared
         scripts step below) and reconciles against active
         `backlog.d/` files.
       - The strategic layer modes: brainstorm / ceo-review /
         technical bench / research / investigate. Each mode's
         trigger vocabulary and dispatch pattern is universal; the
         tailored content is the repo's prioritization scheme,
         grooming cadence, and tracker surfaces.
       - The canonical tracker set is `backlog.d/` (file-driven)
         plus GitHub issues when they exist — name both
         explicitly. Do not reintroduce retired third-party
         trackers; any still-referenced retired tracker is a
         stale-source signal that must be scrubbed from the
         rewrite.
     - **`/settle` rewriter** — must preserve:
       - The polish-loop framing (CI → code-review → refactor
         until merge-ready). `/settle` stops at merge-ready; it
         does NOT merge. Landing is `/ship`'s job.
       - Hand-off to `/ship` (not `/land`). The `/land` trigger is
         retired; any source text carrying it is stale and must be
         rewritten to point at `/ship`.
       - Do not reintroduce retired third-party trackers; only
         `backlog.d/` and GitHub issues are valid references.
     - **`/flywheel` rewriter** — must preserve:
       - The composition `pick → /shape → /implement → /yeet →
         /settle → /ship → /monitor → loop`. `/ship` owns closure
         (archive + reflect + harness routing). `/flywheel` does
         not invoke `/reflect` directly and does not archive
         tickets itself.
       - Harness edits from `/reflect` never touch master; they
         route to `harness/reflect-outputs` via `/ship`.
     - **`/implement` rewriter** — must preserve:
       - The branch-naming invariant `git checkout -b
         <type>/<id>-<slug>` where `<type>` is one of
         `feat|fix|chore|refactor|docs|test|perf` and `<id>` is
         the bare numeric backlog ID. The branch name IS the
         backlog claim — `/ship` reads the ID back out of it via
         the regex above. Rewriters must not weaken this to a
         free-form branch name or repo-specific prefix scheme
         without coordinating a matching change in `/ship`.

     **Rewriters may add sections, delete irrelevant structure,
     and restructure — the spellbook source is a reference, not
     a template to fill in.** Stack-native content (Elixir
     `:observer` + `:telemetry`, Rust `cargo miri`, Go `-race`,
     OTP supervision patterns) often has no slot in the JS/TS-
     shaped source. Add the section. Conversely, if the source
     has content that doesn't apply (matrix builds for a
     single-target repo, Playwright config for a CLI), delete it.
     Find-and-replace at the noun level produces B+ output; real
     tailoring restructures where the repo demands it.

     **Critic reviews all rewrites together, not individually.**
     Three checks: (1) **depth** — subtractive test, would this
     rewrite be wrong if applied to another repo with the same
     stack? If no, it's shallow — reject; (2) **cohesion** — does
     every gate-adjacent skill cite the same load-bearing gate
     from the repo brief? Any contradiction against repo brief or
     sibling skills → reject; (3) **completeness** — byte-identical
     to spellbook source → reject. Critic sends specific rewriters
     back with specific objections. Iterate until coherent. Up to
     3 rounds; critic judges convergence.
   - **Domain skills (invented)** — greenfield additions like
     `/convex-migrate`, `/rust-unsafe-reviewer`. Only invent when you
     can name the concrete repo characteristic demanding it.

7. **Write `AGENTS.md`.** Project the repo brief + the coherent
   rewrite set into a router (not a manual). Suggested structure:
   - **Stack & boundaries** — stack names and what each layer owns.
   - **Ground-truth pointers** — files that ARE the API (e.g.
     `convex/_generated/api.d.ts`); stale training data lies.
   - **Invariants** — hard rules specific to this repo (functions,
     env vars, schema constraints, auth flows).
   - **Gate contract** — cite the load-bearing gate from the repo
     brief; enumerate pre-commit hooks, what humans do, what's
     enforced where.
   - **Known-debt map** — concrete file/line pointers. Every P0
     debt item gets a filed issue ID, not `(unfiled)`. If the repo
     brief surfaced a P0 with no tracker ID, file it (`gh issue
     create` or `backlog.d/NNN-*.md`) before writing this section.
     Debt-map entries like `INCIDENT-*.md` filenames are pointers,
     not IDs — attach a tracker ID.
   - **Harness index** — table: installed skill → what it does
     *here* (not the generic description). Agents in a sibling
     table, not a prose sentence.

8. **Write per-harness settings.** Each harness has its own
   settings format and path; emit one variant per harness:
   - `.claude/settings.local.json` (JSON, Claude Code)
   - `.codex/config.toml` (TOML, Codex)
   - `.pi/settings.json` (JSON, Pi)

   Permissions allowlist (and any other per-harness toggles)
   derive from the tools actually in use. Merge additively with
   any existing file — don't nuke user-added entries. Emit all
   three so the harness can be swapped without re-tailoring.

## Invariants

- Never write outside the current repo. No `$SPELLBOOK` mutation,
  no `~/.claude` / `~/.codex` / `~/.pi` mutation.
- **Workflow skills split into two tiers.** (Universal skills —
  `groom`, `office-hours`, `ceo-review`, `reflect` — are *also*
  always-present via step 6's universal category; they install
  verbatim, not tailored. Functionally always-present.)
  - **Always install** (orchestrators, foundational loop skills,
    and judgment-only skills): `deliver`, `shape`, `implement`,
    `code-review`, `ci`, `refactor`, `flywheel`, `settle`, `ship`,
    `yeet`, `diagnose`, `research`. **Never skipped, under any
    justification.** A repo without a CI pipeline *today* still gets
    `/ci` — the skill drives local gates and establishes the shipping
    contract. Spellbook is the source of `/flywheel`; any repo that
    articulates a `/deliver` → `/flywheel` loop must ship the
    orchestrator. `/ship` is the closure stage (archive, squash,
    reflect, harness routing); `/settle` leaves branches
    merge-ready and `/ship` lands them — the pair is indivisible.
    `/diagnose` is the merged investigate/audit/debug skill
    (reserved-name collisions retired `/investigate` and `/debug`);
    every repo has bugs to investigate. `/research` is always
    tailored, not copied — its tool preferences, domain sources, and
    prior-artifact pointers are repo-specific even though the
    protocol is universal. An exact-copy install is a valid tailoring
    outcome only for a repo that is itself the canonical source;
    silent skip is a regression.
  - **Infrastructure-tied, skip only with named absence.** `deploy`
    (no deploy target named in `vercel.json` / `fly.*.toml` /
    `Dockerfile*` / `.github/workflows/*deploy*`), `monitor` (no signal
    surfaces — Sentry, health endpoints, observability config),
    `qa` (no browser/E2E surface), `demo` (no demo scripts /
    evidence capture tooling). Skipping requires naming the concrete
    missing file; "didn't seem relevant" does not count. **Confusing
    an orchestrator's missing leaf step with the orchestrator itself
    is the trap:** no `/deploy` target does not justify skipping
    `/flywheel`; no `/qa` surface does not justify skipping
    `/code-review`.
- **Domain skills default to exclude.** Invent only when you can
  name the concrete repo characteristic demanding it. "We might want
  X" is not a name.
- **No `references/<repo-name>.md` sidecar files.** If a skill has
  repo-specific content, it belongs in the SKILL.md body. A sidecar
  named after the repo is the sewn-on-sleeve anti-pattern — the
  generic jacket with an appendix. Forbidden.

  *Permitted:* stack-specific references under their own topic
  (`references/elixir-observability.md`, `references/convex-
  patterns.md`, `references/otp-supervision.md`). These carry
  reusable content that's too deep for SKILL.md progressive
  disclosure — not a repo appendix. If the name could apply to
  another repo on the same stack, it's fine. If the name is this
  repo, rewrite it into SKILL.md.
- **Self-audit before declaring done.** Six checks:
  1. **Workflow rewrites:** `diff` each installed workflow SKILL.md
     against the spellbook source. Byte-identical = rewriter
     dropped the ball. Go back and redo.
  2. **Always-install coverage:** every skill in the always-install
     tier (`deliver`, `shape`, `implement`, `code-review`, `ci`,
     `refactor`, `flywheel`, `settle`, `ship`, `yeet`, `diagnose`,
     `research`) resolves to a directory under the shared skill
     root. Zero missing. If one is absent, the run failed —
     reinstall before declaring done.
  3. **Excluded workflows:** only skills from the infrastructure-tied
     tier may be skipped, and each skip names the concrete missing
     file (no `vercel.json`, no `fly.*.toml`, no `Dockerfile*`, no
     `.github/workflows/*deploy*`, no browser/E2E config — concrete
     absence, not "didn't seem relevant"). An always-install skill
     appearing in the skipped list is a critical regression.
  4. **Agent installation:** grep every installed skill for
     `subagent_type:` references. Every referenced agent must resolve
     to a file in the repo's installed agent directory (usually
     `.claude/agents/`). A `/code-review` that dispatches
     `ousterhout` + `carmack` + `grug` against nonexistent agent
     files is a silent regression — the skill fails at call time.
  5. **Shared scripts present:** `scripts/lib/backlog.sh` and
     `scripts/lib/verdicts.sh` exist at the repo root and match
     spellbook content. `/ship` and `/groom tidy` source
     `backlog.sh`; `/ship` and `/settle` source `verdicts.sh`. A
     missing or diverged library is a silent-sourcing failure at
     call time. Also grep installed skills for retired
     third-party tracker names — zero hits. Any residual reference
     to a retired tracker is a stale-rewrite regression; the
     canonical tracker set is `backlog.d/` plus GitHub issues.
  6. **AGENTS.md debt map:** zero `(unfiled)` entries. Every P0 has
     a filed tracker ID.

  Silent skip is the failure mode that ships B+ output when A is
  the bar.
- Preserve self-containment. When you copy or rewrite a skill, its
  `references/` and `scripts/` stay with it.
- **Cross-harness install.** Spellbook-distributed skills live in a
  shared repo-local skill root (`.agent/skills/` or
  `.agents/skills/`). Harness-specific skill dirs such as
  `.claude/skills/` are symlink bridges back to that shared root,
  not duplicate copies. A repo installed Claude-only is harness-
  locked by construction. AGENTS.md at the repo root is already
  harness-neutral. Per-harness settings files (`.claude/settings.
  local.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.pi/settings.json`) are still
  emitted per-harness because their formats differ. Agents may stay
  in a harness-native agent directory until the repo has a documented
  shared-agent convention.
- **Non-destructive by default.** Never delete content in the shared
  skill root or any harness dir that lacks a `.spellbook` marker
  with `installed-by: tailor`. If reconciliation wants to remove
  something unmarked, ask the user first. Tailor owns `AGENTS.md`
  (overwrite is fine; pre-existing AGENTS.md without a prior
  tailor run should prompt confirmation) and
  `.spellbook/repo-brief.md` (always overwrite).
- **Settings merge, not overwrite.** When writing any harness
  settings file, merge with the existing file additively —
  user-added permissions entries survive. Only the entries this
  run derived from actual tool usage are your contribution.

## What "tailored" means

At the SKILL.md level: every example is a repo-specific example.
Every command names the actual command the user runs here. Every
gotcha points to a real file in this repo. The skill reads like it
was written *for this codebase* — because it was.

**Bad** (generic + appended notes):

```
## Inner loop
Run your project's test command.

## Repo notes (this-repo)
Tests are run via `pnpm test --run <path>`.
```

**Good** (rewritten):

```
## Inner loop
Run `pnpm test --run <path>` (happy-dom, fast). For pre-push, use
`pnpm ci:prepush` — the Dagger pipeline runs Vitest + Playwright
+ gitleaks, same contract as the hosted CI gate.
```

The generic jacket + notes is fast. It's also wrong — the agent
reading the generic body first then reconciling with an appendix
runs a parallax failure. Write the skill for this repo in the first
place.
